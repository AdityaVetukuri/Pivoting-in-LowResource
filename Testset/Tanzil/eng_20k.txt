O mankind indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another
Indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you
Indeed Allah is Knowing and Acquainted
The bedouins say We have believed
Say You have not yet believed but say instead We have submitted for faith has not yet entered your hearts
And if you obey Allah and His Messenger He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah
It is those who are the truthful
Say Would you acquaint Allah with your religion while Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and Allah is Knowing of all things
They consider it a favor to you that they have accepted Islam
Say Do not consider your Islam a favor to me
Rather Allah has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the faith if you should be truthful
Indeed Allah knows the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth
And Allah is Seeing of what you do
Qaf
By the honored Qur an
But they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say This is an amazing thing
When we have died and have become dust we will return to life
That is a distant return
We know what the earth diminishes of them and with Us is a retaining record
But they denied the truth when it came to them so they are in a confused condition
Have they not looked at the heaven above them how We structured it and adorned it and how it has no rifts
And the earth We spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein something of every beautiful kind
Giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns to Allah
And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest
And lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers
As provision for the servants and We have given life thereby to a dead land
Thus is the resurrection
The people of Noah denied before them and the companions of the well and Thamud
And Aad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot
And the companions of the thicket and the people of Tubba All denied the messengers so My threat was justly fulfilled
Did We fail in the first creation
But they are in confusion over a new creation
And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him and We are closer to him than his jugular vein
When the two receivers receive seated on the right and on the left
Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared to record
And the intoxication of death will bring the truth that is what you were trying to avoid
And the Horn will be blown
That is the Day of carrying out the threat
And every soul will come with it a driver and a witness
It will be said You were certainly in unmindfulness of this and We have removed from you your cover so your sight this Day is sharp
And his companion the angel will say This record is what is with me prepared
Allah will say Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever
Preventer of good aggressor and doubter
Who made as equal with Allah another deity then throw him into the severe punishment
His devil companion will say Our Lord I did not make him transgress but he himself was in extreme error
Allah will say Do not dispute before Me while I had already presented to you the warning
The word will not be changed with Me and never will I be unjust to the servants
On the Day We will say to Hell Have you been filled and it will say Are there some more
And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous not far
It will be said This is what you were promised for every returner to Allah and keeper of His covenant
Who feared the Most Merciful unseen and came with a heart returning in repentance
Enter it in peace
This is the Day of Eternity
They will have whatever they wish therein and with Us is more
And how many a generation before them did We destroy who were greater than them in striking power and had explored throughout the lands Is there any place of escape
Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present in mind
And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days and there touched Us no weariness
So be patient O Muhammad over what they say and exalt Allah with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
And in part of the night exalt Him and after prostration
And listen on the Day when the Caller will call out from a place that is near
The Day they will hear the blast of the Horn in truth
That is the Day of Emergence from the graves
Indeed it is We who give life and cause death and to Us is the destination
On the Day the earth breaks away from them and they emerge rapidly that is a gathering easy for Us
We are most knowing of what they say and you are not over them a tyrant
But remind by the Qur an whoever fears My threat
By those winds scattering dust dispersing
And those clouds carrying a load of water
And those ships sailing with ease
And those angels apportioning each matter
Indeed what you are promised is true
And indeed the recompense is to occur
By the heaven containing pathways
Indeed you are in differing speech
Deluded away from the Qur an is he who is deluded
Destroyed are the falsifiers
Who are within a flood of confusion and heedless
They ask When is the Day of Recompense
It is the Day they will be tormented over the Fire
And will be told Taste your torment
This is that for which you were impatient
Indeed the righteous will be among gardens and springs
Accepting what their Lord has given them
Indeed they were before that doers of good
They used to sleep but little of the night
And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness
And from their properties was given the right of the needy petitioner and the deprived
And on the earth are signs for the certain in faith
And in yourselves
Then will you not see
And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised
Then by the Lord of the heaven and earth indeed it is truth just as sure as it is that you are speaking
Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Abraham
When they entered upon him and said We greet you with peace He answered And upon you peace you are a people unknown
Then he went to his family and came with a fat roasted calf
And placed it near them he said Will you not eat
And he felt from them apprehension
They said Fear not and gave him good tidings of a learned boy
And his wife approached with a cry of alarm and struck her face and said I am a barren old woman
They said Thus has said your Lord indeed He is the Wise the Knowing
Abraham said Then what is your business here O messengers
They said Indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
To send down upon them stones of clay
Marked in the presence of your Lord for the transgressors
So We brought out whoever was in the cities of the believers
And We found not within them other than a single house of Muslims
And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
And in Moses was a sign when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority
But he turned away with his supporters and said A magician or a madman
So We took him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea and he was blameworthy
And in Aad was a sign when We sent against them the barren wind
It left nothing of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegrated ruins
And in Thamud when it was said to them Enjoy yourselves for a time
But they were insolent toward the command of their Lord so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on
And they were unable to arise nor could they defend themselves
And We destroyed the people of Noah before indeed they were a people defiantly disobedient
And the heaven We constructed with strength and indeed We are its expander
And the earth We have spread out and excellent is the preparer
And of all things We created two mates perhaps you will remember
So flee to Allah
Indeed I am to you from Him a clear warner
And do not make as equal with Allah another deity
Indeed I am to you from Him a clear warner
Similarly there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said A magician or a madman
Did they suggest it to them
Rather they themselves are a transgressing people
So leave them O Muhammad for you are not to be blamed
And remind for indeed the reminder benefits the believers
And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me
I do not want from them any provision nor do I want them to feed Me
Indeed it is Allah who is the continual Provider the firm possessor of strength
And indeed for those who have wronged is a portion of punishment like the portion of their predecessors so let them not impatiently urge Me
And woe to those who have disbelieved from their Day which they are promised
By the mount
And by a Book inscribed
In parchment spread open
And by the frequented House
And by the heaven raised high
And by the sea filled with fire
Indeed the punishment of your Lord will occur
Of it there is no preventer
On the Day the heaven will sway with circular motion
And the mountains will pass on departing
Then woe that Day to the deniers
Who are in empty discourse amusing themselves
The Day they are thrust toward the fire of Hell with a violent thrust its angels will say
This is the Fire which you used to deny
Then is this magic or do you not see
Enter to burn therein then be patient or impatient it is all the same for you
You are only being recompensed for what you used to do
Indeed the righteous will be in gardens and pleasure
Enjoying what their Lord has given them and their Lord protected them from the punishment of Hellfire
They will be told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
They will be reclining on thrones lined up and We will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
And those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith We will join with them their descendants and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds
Every person for what he earned is retained
And We will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they desire
They will exchange with one another a cup of wine wherein results no ill speech or commission of sin
There will circulate among them servant boys especially for them as if they were pearls wellprotected
And they will approach one another inquiring of each other
They will say Indeed we were previously among our people fearful of displeasing Allah
So Allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire
Indeed we used to supplicate Him before
Indeed it is He who is the Beneficent the Merciful
So remind O Muhammad for you are not by the favor of your Lord a soothsayer or a madman
Or do they say of you A poet for whom we await a misfortune of time
Say Wait for indeed I am with you among the waiters
Or do their minds command them to say this or are they a transgressing people
Or do they say He has made it up
Rather they do not believe
Then let them produce a statement like it if they should be truthful
Or were they created by nothing or were they the creators of themselves
Or did they create the heavens and the earth
Rather they are not certain
Or have they the depositories containing the provision of your Lord
Or are they the controllers of them
Or have they a stairway into the heaven upon which they listen
Then let their listener produce a clear authority
Or has He daughters while you have sons
Or do you O Muhammad ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
Or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
Or do they intend a plan
But those who disbelieve they are the object of a plan
Or have they a deity other than Allah
Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him
And if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling they would say It is merely clouds heaped up
So leave them until they meet their Day in which they will be struck insensible
The Day their plan will not avail them at all nor will they be helped
And indeed for those who have wronged is a punishment before that but most of them do not know
And be patient O Muhammad for the decision of your Lord for indeed you are in Our eyes
And exalt Allah with praise of your Lord when you arise
And in a part of the night exalt Him and after the setting of the stars
By the star when it descends
Your companion Muhammad has not strayed nor has he erred
Nor does he speak from his own inclination
It is not but a revelation revealed
Taught to him by one intense in strength
One of soundness And he rose to his true form
While he was in the higher part of the horizon
Then he approached and descended
And was at a distance of two bow lengths or nearer
And he revealed to His Servant what he revealed
The heart did not lie about what it saw
So will you dispute with him over what he saw
And he certainly saw him in another descent
At the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary
Near it is the Garden of Refuge
When there covered the Lote Tree that which covered it
The sight of the Prophet did not swerve nor did it transgress its limit
He certainly saw of the greatest signs of his Lord
So have you considered alLat and al Uzza
And Manat the third the other one
Is the male for you and for Him the female
That then is an unjust division
They are not but mere names you have named them you and your forefathers for which Allah has sent down no authority They follow not except assumption and what their souls desire and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance
Or is there for man whatever he wishes
Rather to Allah belongs the Hereafter and the first life
And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except only after Allah has permitted it to whom He wills and approves
Indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels female names
And they have thereof no knowledge They follow not except assumption and indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all
So turn away from whoever turns his back on Our message and desires not except the worldly life
That is their sum of knowledge
Indeed your Lord is most knowing of who strays from His way and He is most knowing of who is guided
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that He may recompense those who do evil with the penalty of what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best reward
Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities only committing slight ones
Indeed your Lord is vast in forgiveness
He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers
So do not claim yourselves to be pure He is most knowing of who fears Him
Have you seen the one who turned away
And gave a little and then refrained
Does he have knowledge of the unseen so he sees
Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses
And of Abraham who fulfilled his obligations
That no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
And that there is not for man except that good for which he strives
And that his effort is going to be seen
Then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
And that to your Lord is the finality
And that it is He who makes one laugh and weep
And that it is He who causes death and gives life
And that He creates the two mates the male and female
From a spermdrop when it is emitted
And that incumbent upon Him is the next creation
And that it is He who enriches and suffices
And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius
And that He destroyed the first people of Aad
And Thamud and He did not spare them
And the people of Noah before Indeed it was they who were even more unjust and oppressing
And the overturned towns He hurled down
And covered them by that which He covered
Then which of the favors of your Lord do you doubt
This Prophet is a warner like the former warners
The Approaching Day has approached
Of it from those besides Allah there is no remover
Then at this statement do you wonder
And you laugh and do not weep
While you are proudly sporting
So prostrate to Allah and worship Him
The Hour has come near and the moon has split in two
And if they see a miracle they turn away and say Passing magic
And they denied and followed their inclinations
But for every matter is a time of settlement
And there has already come to them of information that in which there is deterrence
Extensive wisdom but warning does not avail them
So leave them O Muhammad
The Day the Caller calls to something forbidding
Their eyes humbled they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading
Racing ahead toward the Caller The disbelievers will say This is a difficult Day
The people of Noah denied before them and they denied Our servant and said A madman and he was repelled
So he invoked his Lord Indeed I am overpowered so help
Then We opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down
And caused the earth to burst with springs and the waters met for a matter already predestined
And We carried him on a construction of planks and nails
Sailing under Our observation as reward for he who had been denied
And We left it as a sign so is there any who will remember
And how severe were My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
Aad denied and how severe were My punishment and warning
Indeed We sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune
Extracting the people as if they were trunks of palm trees uprooted
And how severe were My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
Thamud denied the warning
And said Is it one human being among us that we should follow
Indeed we would then be in error and madness
Has the message been sent down upon him from among us
Rather he is an insolent liar
They will know tomorrow who is the insolent liar
Indeed We are sending the shecamel as trial for them so watch them and be patient
And inform them that the water is shared between them each day of drink attended by turn
But they called their companion and he dared and hamstrung her
And how severe were My punishment and warning
Indeed We sent upon them one blast from the sky and they became like the dry twig fragments of an animal pen
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
The people of Lot denied the warning
Indeed We sent upon them a storm of stones except the family of Lot We saved them before dawn
As favor from us
Thus do We reward he who is grateful
And he had already warned them of Our assault but they disputed the warning
And they had demanded from him his guests but We obliterated their eyes saying Taste My punishment and warning
And there came upon them by morning an abiding punishment
So taste My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
And there certainly came to the people of Pharaoh warning
They denied Our signs all of them so We seized them with a seizure of one Exalted in Might and Perfect in Ability
Are your disbelievers better than those former ones or have you immunity in the scripture
Or do they say We are an assembly supporting each other
Their assembly will be defeated and they will turn their backs in retreat
But the Hour is their appointment for due punishment and the Hour is more disastrous and more bitter
Indeed the criminals are in error and madness
The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces it will be said Taste the touch of Saqar
Indeed all things We created with predestination
And Our command is but one like a glance of the eye
And We have already destroyed your kinds so is there any who will remember
And everything they did is in written records
And every small and great thing is inscribed
Indeed the righteous will be among gardens and rivers
In a seat of honor near a Sovereign Perfect in Ability
The Most Merciful
Taught the Qur an
Created man
And taught him eloquence
The sun and the moon move by precise calculation
And the stars and trees prostrate
And the heaven He raised and imposed the balance
That you not transgress within the balance
And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance
And the earth He laid out for the creatures
Therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths of dates
And grain having husks and scented plants
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He created man from clay like that of pottery
And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He is Lord of the two sunrises and Lord of the two sunsets
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He released the two seas meeting side by side
Between them is a barrier so neither of them transgresses
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
From both of them emerge pearl and coral
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And to Him belong the ships with sails elevated in the sea like mountains
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Everyone upon the earth will perish
And there will remain the Face of your Lord Owner of Majesty and Honor
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Whoever is within the heavens and earth asks Him every day He is bringing about a matter
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
We will attend to you O prominent beings
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
O company of jinn and mankind if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth then pass
You will not pass except by authority from Allah
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
There will be sent upon you a flame of fire and smoke and you will not defend yourselves
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And when the heaven is split open and becomes rosecolored like oil
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Then on that Day none will be asked about his sin among men or jinn
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
The criminals will be known by their marks and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
This is Hell which the criminals deny
They will go around between it and scalding water heated to the utmost degree
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
But for he who has feared the position of his Lord are two gardens
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Having spreading branches
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are two springs flowing
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are of every fruit two kinds
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
They are reclining on beds whose linings are of silk brocade and the fruit of the two gardens is hanging low
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In them are women limiting their glances untouched before them by man or jinni
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
As if they were rubies and coral
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Is the reward for good anything but good
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And below them both in excellence are two other gardens
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Dark green in color
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are two springs spouting
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are fruit and palm trees and pomegranates
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In them are good and beautiful women
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Fair ones reserved in pavilions
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Untouched before them by man or jinni
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Blessed is the name of your Lord Owner of Majesty and Honor
When the Occurrence occurs
There is at its occurrence no denial
It will bring down some and raise up others
When the earth is shaken with convulsion
And the mountains are broken down crumbling
And become dust dispersing
And you become of three kinds
Then the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
And the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
And the forerunners the forerunners
Those are the ones brought near to Allah
In the Gardens of Pleasure
A large company of the former peoples
And a few of the later peoples
On thrones woven with ornament
Reclining on them facing each other
There will circulate among them young boys made eternal
With vessels pitchers and a cup of wine from a flowing spring
No headache will they have therefrom nor will they be intoxicated
And fruit of what they select
And the meat of fowl from whatever they desire
And for them are fair women with large beautiful eyes
The likenesses of pearls wellprotected
As reward for what they used to do
They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin
Only a saying Peace peace
The companions of the right what are the companions of the right
They will be among lote trees with thorns removed
And banana trees layered with fruit
And shade extended
And water poured out
And fruit abundant and varied
Neither limited to season nor forbidden
And upon beds raised high
Indeed We have produced the women of Paradise in a new creation
And made them virgins
Devoted to their husbands and of equal age
For the companions of the right who are
A company of the former peoples
And a company of the later peoples
And the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
They will be in scorching fire and scalding water
And a shade of black smoke
Neither cool nor beneficial
Indeed they were before that indulging in affluence
And they used to persist in the great violation
And they used to say When we die and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
And our forefathers as well
Say O Muhammad Indeed the former and the later peoples
Are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known Day
Then indeed you O those astray who are deniers
Will be eating from trees of zaqqum
And filling with it your bellies
And drinking on top of it from scalding water
And will drink as the drinking of thirsty camels
That is their accommodation on the Day of Recompense
We have created you so why do you not believe
Have you seen that which you emit
Is it you who creates it or are We the Creator
We have decreed death among you and We are not to be outdone
In that We will change your likenesses and produce you in that form which you do not know
And you have already known the first creation so will you not remember
And have you seen that seed which you sow
Is it you who makes it grow or are We the grower
If We willed We could make it dry debris and you would remain in wonder
Saying Indeed we are now in debt
Rather we have been deprived
And have you seen the water that you drink
Is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it We who bring it down
If We willed We could make it bitter so why are you not grateful
And have you seen the fire that you ignite
Is it you who produced its tree or are We the producer
We have made it a reminder and provision for the travelers
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
Then I swear by the setting of the stars
And indeed it is an oath if you could know most great
Indeed it is a noble Qur an
In a Register wellprotected
None touch it except the purified
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
Then is it to this statement that you are indifferent
And make the thanks for your provision that you deny the Provider
Then why when the soul at death reaches the throat
And you are at that time looking on
And Our angels are nearer to him than you but you do not see
Then why do you not if you are not to be recompensed
Bring it back if you should be truthful
And if the deceased was of those brought near to Allah
Then for him is rest and bounty and a garden of pleasure
And if he was of the companions of the right
Then the angels will say Peace for you you are from the companions of the right
But if he was of the deniers who were astray
Then for him is accommodation of scalding water
And burning in Hellfire
Indeed this is the true certainty
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
Whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
His is the dominion of the heavens and earth
He gives life and causes death and He is over all things competent
He is the First and the Last the Ascendant and the Intimate and He is of all things Knowing
It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne
He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and He is with you wherever you are
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
His is the dominion of the heavens and earth
And to Allah are returned all matters
He causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and he is Knowing of that within the breasts
Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successors
For those who have believed among you and spent there will be a great reward
And why do you not believe in Allah while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your covenant if you should truly be believers
It is He who sends down upon His Servant Muhammad verses of clear evidence that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light
And indeed Allah is to you Kind and Merciful
And why do you not spend in the cause of Allah while to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest of Makkah and fought and those who did so after it
Those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought
But to all Allah has promised the best reward
And Allah with what you do is Acquainted
Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward
On the Day you see the believing men and believing women their light proceeding before them and on their right it will be said Your good tidings today are of gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein you will abide eternally
That is what is the great attainment
On the same Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light
It will be said Go back behind you and seek light
And a wall will be placed between them with a door its interior containing mercy but on the outside of it is torment
The hypocrites will call to the believers Were we not with you
They will say Yes but you afflicted yourselves and awaited misfortune for us and doubted and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of Allah
And the Deceiver deceived you concerning Allah
So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved
Your refuge is the Fire
It is most worthy of you and wretched is the destination
Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth
And let them not be like those who were given the Scripture before and a long period passed over them so their hearts hardened and many of them are defiantly disobedient
Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness
We have made clear to you the signs perhaps you will understand
Indeed the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and they who have loaned Allah a goodly loan it will be multiplied for them and they will have a noble reward
And those who have believed in Allah and His messengers those are in the ranks of the supporters of truth and the martyrs with their Lord
For them is their reward and their light
But those who have disbelieved and denied Our verses those are the companions of Hellfire
Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children like the example of a rain whose resulting plant growth pleases the tillers then it dries and you see it turned yellow then it becomes scattered debris
And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and approval
And what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion
Race toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth prepared for those who believed in Allah and His messengers
That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills and Allah is the possessor of great bounty
No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being indeed that for Allah is easy
In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult in pride over what He has given you
And Allah does not like everyone selfdeluded and boastful
Those who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess
And whoever turns away then indeed Allah is the Free of need the Praiseworthy
We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain their affairs in justice
And We sent down iron wherein is great military might and benefits for the people and so that Allah may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen
Indeed Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might
And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture and among them is he who is guided but many of them are defiantly disobedient
Then We sent following their footsteps Our messengers and followed them with Jesus the son of Mary and gave him the Gospel
And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism which they innovated We did not prescribe it for them except that they did so seeking the approval of Allah
But they did not observe it with due observance
So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward but many of them are defiantly disobedient
O you who have believed fear Allah and believe in His Messenger He will then give you a double portion of His mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
This is so that the People of the Scripture may know that they are not able to obtain anything from the bounty of Allah and that all bounty is in the hand of Allah He gives it to whom He wills And Allah is the possessor of great bounty
Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you O Muhammad concerning her husband and directs her complaint to Allah
And Allah hears your dialogue indeed Allah is Hearing and Seeing
Those who pronounce thihar among you to separate from their wives they are not consequently their mothers
Their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them
And indeed they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood
But indeed Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving
And those who pronounce thihar from their wives and then wish to go back on what they said then there must be the freeing of a slave before they touch one another
That is what you are admonished thereby and Allah is Acquainted with what you do
And he who does not find a slave then a fast for two months consecutively before they touch one another and he who is unable then the feeding of sixty poor persons
That is for you to believe completely in Allah and His Messenger and those are the limits set by Allah
And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Messenger are abased as those before them were abased
And We have certainly sent down verses of clear evidence
And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did
Allah had enumerated it while they forgot it and Allah is over all things Witness
Have you not considered that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth
There is in no private conversation three but that He is the fourth of them nor are there five but that He is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that He is with them in knowledge wherever they are
Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection
Indeed Allah is of all things Knowing
Have you not considered those who were forbidden from private conversation then they return to that which they were forbidden and converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger
And when they come to you they greet you with that word by which Allah does not greet you and say among themselves Why does Allah not punish us for what we say
Sufficient for them is Hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the destination
O you who have believed when you converse privately do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger but converse about righteousness and piety And fear Allah to whom you will be gathered
Private conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve those who have believed but he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allah
And upon Allah let the believers rely
O you who have believed when you are told Space yourselves in assemblies then make space Allah will make space for you
And when you are told Arise then arise Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
O you who have believed when you wish to privately consult the Messenger present before your consultation a charity
That is better for you and purer
But if you find not the means then indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Have you feared to present before your consultation charities
Then when you do not and Allah has forgiven you then at least establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
Have you not considered those who make allies of a people with whom Allah has become angry
They are neither of you nor of them and they swear to untruth while they know they are lying
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
Indeed it was evil that they were doing
They took their false oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of Allah and for them is a humiliating punishment
Never will their wealth or their children avail them against Allah at all
Those are the companions of the Fire they will abide therein eternally
On the Day Allah will resurrect them all and they will swear to Him as they swear to you and think that they are standing on something
Unquestionably it is they who are the liars
Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah
Those are the party of Satan
Unquestionably the party of Satan they will be the losers
Indeed the ones who oppose Allah and His Messenger those will be among the most humbled
Allah has written I will surely overcome I and My messengers
Indeed Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might
You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred
Those He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him
And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally
Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him those are the party of Allah
Unquestionably the party of Allah they are the successful
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering You did not think they would leave and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah but the decree of Allah came upon them from where they had not expected and He cast terror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses by their own hands and the hands of the believers So take warning O people of vision
And if not that Allah had decreed for them evacuation He would have punished them in this world and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire
That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger
And whoever opposes Allah then indeed Allah is severe in penalty
Whatever you have cut down of their palm trees or left standing on their trunks it was by permission of Allah and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient
And what Allah restored of property to His Messenger from them you did not spur for it in an expedition any horses or camels but Allah gives His messengers power over whom He wills and Allah is over all things competent
And what Allah restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns it is for Allah and for the Messenger and for his near relatives and orphans and the stranded traveler so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you
And whatever the Messenger has given you take and what he has forbidden you refrain from
And fear Allah indeed Allah is severe in penalty
For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties seeking bounty from Allah and His approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger there is also a share Those are the truthful
And also for those who were settled in alMadinah and adopted the faith before them They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give them preference over themselves even though they are in privation
And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
And there is a share for those who came after them saying Our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any resentment toward those who have believed Our Lord indeed You are Kind and Merciful
Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture If you are expelled we will surely leave with you and we will not obey in regard to you anyone ever and if you are fought we will surely aid you
But Allah testifies that they are liars
If they are expelled they will not leave with them and if they are fought they will not aid them
And even if they should aid them they will surely turn their backs then thereafter they will not be aided
You believers are more fearful within their breasts than Allah
That is because they are a people who do not understand
They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls
Their violence among themselves is severe
You think they are together but their hearts are diverse
That is because they are a people who do not reason
Theirs is like the example of those shortly before them they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
The hypocrites are like the example of Satan when he says to man Disbelieve
But when he disbelieves he says Indeed I am disassociated from you
Indeed I fear Allah Lord of the worlds
So the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire abiding eternally therein
And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers
O you who have believed fear Allah
And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow and fear Allah
Indeed Allah is Acquainted with what you do
And be not like those who forgot Allah so He made them forget themselves
Those are the defiantly disobedient
Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise
The companions of Paradise they are the attainers of success
If We had sent down this Qur an upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah
And these examples We present to the people that perhaps they will give thought
He is Allah other than whom there is no deity Knower of the unseen and the witnessed
He is the Entirely Merciful the Especially Merciful
He is Allah other than whom there is no deity the Sovereign the Pure the Perfection the Bestower of Faith the Overseer the Exalted in Might the Compeller the Superior
Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him
He is Allah the Creator the Inventor the Fashioner to Him belong the best names
Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him
And He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
O you who have believed do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth having driven out the Prophet and yourselves only because you believe in Allah your Lord
If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval take them not as friends
You confide to them affection but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared
And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
If they gain dominance over you they would be to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil and they wish you would disbelieve
Never will your relatives or your children benefit you the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people Indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah We have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone except for the saying of Abraham to his father I will surely ask forgiveness for you but I have not power to do for you anything against Allah Our Lord upon You we have relied and to You we have returned and to You is the destination
Our Lord make us not objects of torment for the disbelievers and forgive us our Lord Indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might the Wise
There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day
And whoever turns away then indeed Allah is the Free of need the Praiseworthy
Perhaps Allah will put between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them affection
And Allah is competent and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them
Indeed Allah loves those who act justly
Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion forbids that you make allies of them
And whoever makes allies of them then it is those who are the wrongdoers
O you who have believed when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them
Allah is most knowing as to their faith
And if you know them to be believers then do not return them to the disbelievers they are not lawful wives for them nor are they lawful husbands for them
But give the disbelievers what they have spent
And there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation
And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent
That is the judgement of Allah He judges between you
And Allah is Knowing and Wise
And if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain something then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent
And fear Allah in whom you are believers
O Prophet when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allah nor will they steal nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse nor will they kill their children nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs nor will they disobey you in what is right then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of Allah
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
O you who have believed do not make allies of a people with whom Allah has become angry
They have despaired of reward in the Hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of meeting the inhabitants of the graves
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
O you who have believed why do you say what you do not do
Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do
Indeed Allah loves those who fight in His cause in a row as though they are a single structure joined firmly
And mention O Muhammad when Moses said to his people O my people why do you harm me while you certainly know that I am the messenger of Allah to you
And when they deviated Allah caused their hearts to deviate
And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
And mention when Jesus the son of Mary said O children of Israel indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me whose name is Ahmad
But when he came to them with clear evidences they said This is obvious magic
And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah untruth while he is being invited to Islam
And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah will perfect His light although the disbelievers dislike it
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although those who associate others with Allah dislike it
O you who have believed shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment
It is that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives
That is best for you if you should know
He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence
That is the great attainment
And you will obtain another favor that you love victory from Allah and an imminent conquest and give good tidings to the believers
O you who have believed be supporters of Allah as when Jesus the son of Mary said to the disciples Who are my supporters for Allah The disciples said We are supporters of Allah
And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and a faction disbelieved
So We supported those who believed against their enemy and they became dominant
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah the Sovereign the Pure the Exalted in Might the Wise
It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom although they were before in clear error
And to others of them who have not yet joined them And He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills and Allah is the possessor of great bounty
The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes of books
Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of Allah
And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
Say O you who are Jews if you claim that you are allies of Allah excluding the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
But they will not wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth
And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers
Say Indeed the death from which you flee indeed it will meet you
Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed and He will inform you about what you used to do
O you who have believed when the adhan is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu ah Friday then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade
That is better for you if you only knew
And when the prayer has been concluded disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allah and remember Allah often that you may succeed
But when they saw a transaction or a diversion O Muhammad they rushed to it and left you standing Say What is with Allah is better than diversion and than a transaction and Allah is the best of providers
When the hypocrites come to you O Muhammad they say We testify that you are the Messenger of Allah
And Allah knows that you are His Messenger and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars
They have taken their oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of Allah
Indeed it was evil that they were doing
That is because they believed and then they disbelieved so their hearts were sealed over and they do not understand
And when you see them their forms please you and if they speak you listen to their speech
They are as if they were pieces of wood propped up they think that every shout is against them
They are the enemy so beware of them
May Allah destroy them how are they deluded
And when it is said to them Come the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant
It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them never will Allah forgive them
Indeed Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
They are the ones who say Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah until they disband
And to Allah belongs the depositories of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
They say If we return to alMadinah the more honored for power will surely expel therefrom the more humble
And to Allah belongs all honor and to His Messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
O you who have believed let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of Allah
And whoever does that then those are the losers
And spend in the way of Allah from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says My Lord if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous
But never will Allah delay a soul when its time has come
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah
To Him belongs dominion and to Him belongs all praise and He is over all things competent
It is He who created you and among you is the disbeliever and among you is the believer
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms and to Him is the final destination
He knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare
And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts
Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before
So they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences but they said Shall human beings guide us and disbelieved and turned away
And Allah dispensed with them and Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy
Those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected
Say Yes by my Lord you will surely be resurrected then you will surely be informed of what you did
And that for Allah is easy
So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Qur an which We have sent down
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly that is the Day of Deprivation
And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever
That is the great attainment
But the ones who disbelieved and denied Our verses those are the companions of the Fire abiding eternally therein and wretched is the destination
No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah
And whoever believes in Allah He will guide his heart
And Allah is Knowing of all things
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger but if you turn away then upon Our Messenger is only the duty of clear notification
Allah there is no deity except Him
And upon Allah let the believers rely
O you who have believed indeed among your wives and your children are enemies to you so beware of them But if you pardon and overlook and forgive then indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Your wealth and your children are but a trial and Allah has with Him a great reward
So fear Allah as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend in the way of Allah it is better for your selves
And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
If you loan Allah a goodly loan He will multiply it for you and forgive you
And Allah is Most Appreciative and Forbearing
Knower of the unseen and the witnessed the Exalted in Might the Wise
O Prophet when you Muslims divorce women divorce them for the commencement of their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period and fear Allah your Lord
Do not turn them out of their husbands houses nor should they themselves leave during that period unless they are committing a clear immorality
And those are the limits set by Allah
And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself
You know not perhaps Allah will bring about after that a different matter
And when they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or part with them according to acceptable terms
And bring to witness two just men from among you and establish the testimony for the acceptance of Allah
That is instructed to whoever should believe in Allah and the Last day
And whoever fears Allah He will make for him a way out
And will provide for him from where he does not expect
And whoever relies upon Allah then He is sufficient for him
Indeed Allah will accomplish His purpose
Allah has already set for everything a decreed extent
And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women if you doubt then their period is three months and also for those who have not menstruated
And for those who are pregnant their term is until they give birth
And whoever fears Allah He will make for him of his matter ease
That is the command of Allah which He has sent down to you and whoever fears Allah He will remove for him his misdeeds and make great for him his reward
Lodge them in a section of where you dwell out of your means and do not harm them in order to oppress them
And if they should be pregnant then spend on them until they give birth
And if they breastfeed for you then give them their payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way but if you are in discord then there may breastfeed for the father another woman
Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth and he whose provision is restricted let him spend from what Allah has given him
Allah does not charge a soul except according to what He has given it
Allah will bring about after hardship ease
And how many a city was insolent toward the command of its Lord and His messengers so We took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment
And it tasted the bad consequence of its affair and the outcome of its affair was loss
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment so fear Allah O you of understanding who have believed
Allah has sent down to you the Qur an
He sent a Messenger Muhammad reciting to you the distinct verses of Allah that He may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light
And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever
Allah will have perfected for him a provision
It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them
His command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge
O Prophet why do you prohibit yourself from what Allah has made lawful for you seeking the approval of your wives
And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Allah has already ordained for you Muslims the dissolution of your oaths
And Allah is your protector and He is the Knowing the Wise
And remember when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement and when she informed another of it and Allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored a part
And when he informed her about it she said Who told you this He said I was informed by the Knowing the Acquainted
If you two wives repent to Allah it is best for your hearts have deviated But if you cooperate against him then indeed Allah is his protector and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels moreover are his assistants
Perhaps his Lord if he divorced you all would substitute for him wives better than you submitting to Allah believing devoutly obedient repentant worshipping and traveling ones previously married and virgins
O you who have believed protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are appointed angels harsh and severe they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded
O you who have disbelieved make no excuses that Day
You will only be recompensed for what you used to do
O you who have believed repent to Allah with sincere repentance
Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him
Their light will proceed before them and on their right they will say Our Lord perfect for us our light and forgive us
Indeed You are over all things competent
O Prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them And their refuge is Hell and wretched is the destination
Allah presents an example of those who disbelieved the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot
They were under two of Our righteous servants but betrayed them so those prophets did not avail them from Allah at all and it was said Enter the Fire with those who enter
And Allah presents an example of those who believed the wife of Pharaoh when she said My Lord build for me near You a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people
And the example of Mary the daughter of Imran who guarded her chastity so We blew into her garment through Our angel and she believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient
Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion and He is over all things competent
He who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed and He is the Exalted in Might the Forgiving
And who created seven heavens in layers
You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency
So return your vision to the sky do you see any breaks
Then return your vision twice again
Your vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued
And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made from them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze
And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell and wretched is the destination
When they are thrown into it they hear from it a dreadful inhaling while it boils up
It almost bursts with rage
Every time a company is thrown into it its keepers ask them Did there not come to you a warner
They will say Yes a warner had come to us but we denied and said Allah has not sent down anything
You are not but in great error
And they will say If only we had been listening or reasoning we would not be among the companions of the Blaze
And they will admit their sin so it is alienation for the companions of the Blaze
Indeed those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward
And conceal your speech or publicize it indeed He is Knowing of that within the breasts
Does He who created not know while He is the Subtle the Acquainted
It is He who made the earth tame for you so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision and to Him is the resurrection
Do you feel secure that He who holds authority in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway
Or do you feel secure that He who holds authority in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones
Then you would know how severe was My warning
And already had those before them denied and how terrible was My reproach
Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and sometimes folded in
None holds them aloft except the Most Merciful
Indeed He is of all things Seeing
Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful
The disbelievers are not but in delusion
Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision
But they have persisted in insolence and aversion
Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path
Say It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
Say It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to Him you will be gathered
And they say When is this promise if you should be truthful
Say The knowledge is only with Allah and I am only a clear warner
But when they see it approaching the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed and it will be said This is that for which you used to call
Say O Muhammad Have you considered whether Allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment
Say He is the Most Merciful we have believed in Him and upon Him we have relied
And you will come to know who it is that is in clear error
Say Have you considered if your water was to become sunken into the earth then who could bring you flowing water
Nun
By the pen and what they inscribe
You are not O Muhammad by the favor of your Lord a madman
And indeed for you is a reward uninterrupted
And indeed you are of a great moral character
So you will see and they will see
Which of you is the afflicted by a devil
Indeed your Lord is most knowing of who has gone astray from His way and He is most knowing of the rightly guided
Then do not obey the deniers
They wish that you would soften in your position so they would soften toward you
And do not obey every worthless habitual swearer
And scorner going about with malicious gossip
A preventer of good transgressing and sinful
Cruel moreover and an illegitimate pretender
Because he is a possessor of wealth and children
When Our verses are recited to him he says Legends of the former peoples
We will brand him upon the snout
Indeed We have tried them as We tried the companions of the garden when they swore to cut its fruit in the early morning
Without making exception
So there came upon the garden an affliction from your Lord while they were asleep
And it became as though reaped
And they called one another at morning
Saying Go early to your crop if you would cut the fruit
So they set out while lowering their voices
Saying There will surely not enter it today upon you any poor person
And they went early in determination assuming themselves able
But when they saw it they said Indeed we are lost
Rather we have been deprived
The most moderate of them said Did I not say to you Why do you not exalt Allah
They said Exalted is our Lord
Indeed we were wrongdoers
Then they approached one another blaming each other
They said O woe to us indeed we were transgressors
Perhaps our Lord will substitute for us one better than it
Indeed we are toward our Lord desirous
Such is the punishment of this world
And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they only knew
Indeed for the righteous with their Lord are the Gardens of Pleasure
Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals
What is the matter with you
How do you judge
Or do you have a scripture in which you learn
That indeed for you is whatever you choose
Or do you have oaths binding upon Us extending until the Day of Resurrection that indeed for you is whatever you judge
Ask them which of them for that claim is responsible
Or do they have partners Then let them bring their partners if they should be truthful
The Day the shin will be uncovered and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able
Their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them
And they used to be invited to prostration while they were sound
So leave Me O Muhammad with the matter of whoever denies the Qur an
We will progressively lead them to punishment from where they do not know
And I will give them time
Indeed My plan is firm
Or do you ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
Or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
Then be patient for the decision of your Lord O Muhammad and be not like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed
If not that a favor from his Lord overtook him he would have been thrown onto the naked shore while he was censured
And his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous
And indeed those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message and they say Indeed he is mad
But it is not except a reminder to the worlds
The Inevitable Reality
What is the Inevitable Reality
And what can make you know what is the Inevitable Reality
Thamud and Aad denied the Striking Calamity
So as for Thamud they were destroyed by the overpowering blast
And as for Aad they were destroyed by a screaming violent wind
Which Allah imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees
Then do you see of them any remains
And there came Pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities with sin
And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord so He seized them with a seizure exceeding in severity
Indeed when the water overflowed We carried your ancestors in the sailing ship
That We might make it for you a reminder and that a conscious ear would be conscious of it
Then when the Horn is blown with one blast
And the earth and the mountains are lifted and leveled with one blow
Then on that Day the Resurrection will occur
And the heaven will split open for that Day it is infirm
And the angels are at its edges And there will bear the Throne of your Lord above them that Day eight of them
That Day you will be exhibited for judgement not hidden among you is anything concealed
So as for he who is given his record in his right hand he will say Here read my record
Indeed I was certain that I would be meeting my account
So he will be in a pleasant life
In an elevated garden
Its fruit to be picked hanging near
They will be told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past
But as for he who is given his record in his left hand he will say Oh I wish I had not been given my record
And had not known what is my account
I wish my death had been the decisive one
My wealth has not availed me
Gone from me is my authority
Allah will say Seize him and shackle him
Then into Hellfire drive him
Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him
Indeed he did not used to believe in Allah the Most Great
Nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor
So there is not for him here this Day any devoted friend
Nor any food except from the discharge of wounds
None will eat it except the sinners
So I swear by what you see
And what you do not see
That indeed the Qur an is the word of a noble Messenger
And it is not the word of a poet little do you believe
Nor the word of a soothsayer little do you remember
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
And if Muhammad had made up about Us some false sayings
We would have seized him by the right hand
Then We would have cut from him the aorta
And there is no one of you who could prevent Us from him
And indeed the Qur an is a reminder for the righteous
And indeed We know that among you are deniers
And indeed it will be a cause of regret upon the disbelievers
And indeed it is the truth of certainty
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
A supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen
To the disbelievers of it there is no preventer
It is from Allah owner of the ways of ascent
The angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years
So be patient with gracious patience
Indeed they see it as distant
But We see it as near
On the Day the sky will be like murky oil
And the mountains will be like wool
And no friend will ask anything of a friend
They will be shown each other The criminal will wish that he could be ransomed from the punishment of that Day by his children
And his wife and his brother
And his nearest kindred who shelter him
And whoever is on earth entirely so then it could save him
No
Indeed it is the Flame of Hell
A remover of exteriors
It invites he who turned his back on truth and went away from obedience
And collected wealth and hoarded
Indeed mankind was created anxious
When evil touches him impatient
And when good touches him withholding of it
Except the observers of prayer
Those who are constant in their prayer
And those within whose wealth is a known right
For the petitioner and the deprived
And those who believe in the Day of Recompense
And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord
Indeed the punishment of their Lord is not that from which one is safe
And those who guard their private parts
Except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they are not to be blamed
But whoever seeks beyond that then they are the transgressors
And those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
And those who are in their testimonies upright
And those who carefully maintain their prayer
They will be in gardens honored
So what is the matter with those who disbelieve hastening from before you O Muhammad
To sit on your right and your left in separate groups
Does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure
No Indeed We have created them from that which they know
So I swear by the Lord of all risings and settings that indeed We are able
To replace them with better than them and We are not to be outdone
So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised
The Day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they were toward an erected idol hastening
Their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them
That is the Day which they had been promised
Indeed We sent Noah to his people saying Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment
He said O my people indeed I am to you a clear warner
Saying Worship Allah fear Him and obey me
Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term
Indeed the time set by Allah when it comes will not be delayed if you only knew
He said My Lord indeed I invited my people to truth night and day
But my invitation increased them not except in flight
And indeed every time I invited them that You may forgive them they put their fingers in their ears covered themselves with their garments persisted and were arrogant with great arrogance
Then I invited them publicly
Then I announced to them and also confided to them secretly
And said Ask forgiveness of your Lord
Indeed He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver
He will send rain from the sky upon you in continuing showers
And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers
What is the matter with you that you do not attribute to Allah due grandeur
While He has created you in stages
Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers
And made the moon therein a reflected light and made the sun a burning lamp
And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a progressive growth
Then He will return you into it and extract you another extraction
And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse
That you may follow therein roads of passage
Noah said My Lord indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss
And they conspired an immense conspiracy
And said Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa or Yaghuth and Ya uq and Nasr
And already they have misled many
And my Lord do not increase the wrongdoers except in error
Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire and they found not for themselves besides Allah any helpers
And Noah said My Lord do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant
Indeed if You leave them they will mislead Your servants and not beget except every wicked one and confirmed disbeliever
My Lord forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women
And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction
Say O Muhammad It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said Indeed we have heard an amazing Qur an
It guides to the right course and we have believed in it
And we will never associate with our Lord anyone
And it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord He has not taken a wife or a son
And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression
And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie
And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn so they only increased them in burden
And they had thought as you thought that Allah would never send anyone as a messenger
And we have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames
And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him
And we do not know therefore whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course
And among us are the righteous and among us are others not so we were of divided ways
And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth nor can we escape Him by flight
And when we heard the guidance we believed in it
And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden
And among us are Muslims in submission to Allah and among us are the unjust
And whoever has become Muslim those have sought out the right course
But as for the unjust they will be for Hell firewood
And Allah revealed that if they had remained straight on the way We would have given them abundant provision
So We might test them therein
And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will put into arduous punishment
And He revealed that the masjids are for Allah so do not invoke with Allah anyone
And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him they almost became about him a compacted mass
Say O Muhammad I only invoke my Lord and do not associate with Him anyone
Say Indeed I do not possess for you the power of harm or right direction
Say Indeed there will never protect me from Allah anyone if I should disobey nor will I find in other than Him a refuge
But I have for you only notification from Allah and His messages
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger then indeed for him is the fire of Hell they will abide therein forever
The disbelievers continue until when they see that which they are promised then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number
Say I do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a long period
He is Knower of the unseen and He does not disclose His knowledge of the unseen to anyone
Except whom He has approved of messengers and indeed He sends before each messenger and behind him observers
That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number
O you who wraps himself in clothing
Arise to pray the night except for a little
Half of it or subtract from it a little
Or add to it and recite the Qur an with measured recitation
Indeed We will cast upon you a heavy word
Indeed the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence of heart and tongue and more suitable for words
Indeed for you by day is prolonged occupation
And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with complete devotion
He is the Lord of the East and the West there is no deity except Him so take Him as Disposer of your affairs
And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance
And leave Me with the matter of the deniers those of ease in life and allow them respite a little
Indeed with Us for them are shackles and burning fire
And food that chokes and a painful punishment
On the Day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down
Indeed We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so We seized him with a ruinous seizure
Then how can you fear if you disbelieve a Day that will make the children white haired
The heaven will break apart therefrom ever is His promise fulfilled
Indeed this is a reminder so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way
Indeed your Lord knows O Muhammad that you stand in prayer almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it and so do a group of those with you
And Allah determines the extent of the night and the day
He has known that you Muslims will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness so recite what is easy for you of the Qur an
He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking something of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah
So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a goodly loan
And whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with Allah It is better and greater in reward
And seek forgiveness of Allah
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
O you who covers himself with a garment
Arise and warn
And your Lord glorify
And your clothing purify
And uncleanliness avoid
And do not confer favor to acquire more
But for your Lord be patient
And when the trumpet is blown
That Day will be a difficult day
For the disbelievers not easy
Leave Me with the one I created alone
And to whom I granted extensive wealth
And children present with him
And spread everything before him easing his life
Then he desires that I should add more
No
Indeed he has been toward Our verses obstinate
I will cover him with arduous torment
Indeed he thought and deliberated
So may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
Then may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
Then he considered again
Then he frowned and scowled
Then he turned back and was arrogant
And said This is not but magic imitated from others
This is not but the word of a human being
I will drive him into Saqar
And what can make you know what is Saqar
It lets nothing remain and leaves nothing unburned
Blackening the skins
Over it are nineteen angels
And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels
And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers will say What does Allah intend by this as an example
Thus does Allah leave astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills
And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him
And mention of the Fire is not but a reminder to humanity
No
By the moon
And by the night when it departs
And by the morning when it brightens
Indeed the Fire is of the greatest afflictions
As a warning to humanity
To whoever wills among you to proceed or stay behind
Every soul for what it has earned will be retained
Except the companions of the right
Who will be in gardens questioning each other
About the criminals
And asking them What put you into Saqar
They will say We were not of those who prayed
Nor did we used to feed the poor
And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged in it
And we used to deny the Day of Recompense
Until there came to us the certainty
So there will not benefit them the intercession of any intercessors
Then what is the matter with them that they are from the reminder turning away
As if they were alarmed donkeys
Fleeing from a lion
Rather every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about
No But they do not fear the Hereafter
No Indeed the Qur an is a reminder
Then whoever wills will remember it
And they will not remember except that Allah wills
He is worthy of fear and adequate for granting forgiveness
I swear by the Day of Resurrection
And I swear by the reproaching soul to the certainty of resurrection
Does man think that We will not assemble his bones
Yes We are Able even to proportion his fingertips
But man desires to continue in sin
He asks When is the Day of Resurrection
So when vision is dazzled
And the moon darkens
And the sun and the moon are joined
Man will say on that Day Where is the place of escape
No There is no refuge
To your Lord that Day is the place of permanence
Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back
Rather man against himself will be a witness
Even if he presents his excuses
Move not your tongue with it O Muhammad to hasten with recitation of the Qur an
Indeed upon Us is its collection in your heart and to make possible its recitation
So when We have recited it through Gabriel then follow its recitation
Then upon Us is its clarification to you
No
But you love the immediate
And leave the Hereafter
Some faces that Day will be radiant
Looking at their Lord
And some faces that Day will be contorted
Expecting that there will be done to them something backbreaking
No When the soul has reached the collar bones
And it is said Who will cure him
And the dying one is certain that it is the time of separation
And the leg is wound about the leg
To your Lord that Day will be the procession
And the disbeliever had not believed nor had he prayed
But instead he denied and turned away
And then he went to his people swaggering in pride
Woe to you and woe
Then woe to you and woe
Does man think that he will be left neglected
Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted
Then he was a clinging clot and Allah created his form and proportioned him
And made of him two mates the male and the female
Is not that Creator Able to give life to the dead
Has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing even mentioned
Indeed We created man from a spermdrop mixture that We may try him and We made him hearing and seeing
Indeed We guided him to the way be he grateful or be he ungrateful
Indeed We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze
Indeed the righteous will drink from a cup of wine whose mixture is of Kafur
A spring of which the righteous servants of Allah will drink they will make it gush forth in force and abundance
They are those who fulfill their vows and fear a Day whose evil will be widespread
And they give food in spite of love for it to the needy the orphan and the captive
Saying We feed you only for the countenance of Allah
We wish not from you reward or gratitude
Indeed We fear from our Lord a Day austere and distressful
So Allah will protect them from the evil of that Day and give them radiance and happiness
And will reward them for what they patiently endured with a garden in Paradise and silk garments
They will be reclining therein on adorned couches They will not see therein any burning sun or freezing cold
And near above them are its shades and its fruit to be picked will be lowered in compliance
And there will be circulated among them vessels of silver and cups having been created clear as glass
Clear glasses made from silver of which they have determined the measure
And they will be given to drink a cup of wine whose mixture is of ginger
From a fountain within Paradise named Salsabeel
There will circulate among them young boys made eternal
When you see them you would think them as beautiful as scattered pearls
And when you look there in Paradise you will see pleasure and great dominion
Upon the inhabitants will be green garments of fine silk and brocade And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their Lord will give them a purifying drink
And it will be said Indeed this is for you a reward and your effort has been appreciated
Indeed it is We who have sent down to you O Muhammad the Qur an progressively
So be patient for the decision of your Lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrateful disbeliever
And mention the name of your Lord in prayer morning and evening
And during the night prostrate to Him and exalt Him a long part of the night
Indeed these disbelievers love the immediate and leave behind them a grave Day
We have created them and strengthened their forms and when We will We can change their likenesses with complete alteration
Indeed this is a reminder so he who wills may take to his Lord a way
And you do not will except that Allah wills
Indeed Allah is ever Knowing and Wise
He admits whom He wills into His mercy but the wrongdoers He has prepared for them a painful punishment
By those winds sent forth in gusts
And the winds that blow violently
And by the winds that spread clouds
And those angels who bring criterion
And those angels who deliver a message
As justification or warning
Indeed what you are promised is to occur
So when the stars are obliterated
And when the heaven is opened
And when the mountains are blown away
And when the messengers time has come
For what Day was it postponed
For the Day of Judgement
And what can make you know what is the Day of Judgement
Woe that Day to the deniers
Did We not destroy the former peoples
Then We will follow them with the later ones
Thus do We deal with the criminals
Woe that Day to the deniers
Did We not create you from a liquid disdained
And We placed it in a firm lodging
For a known extent
And We determined it and excellent are We to determine
Woe that Day to the deniers
Have We not made the earth a container
Of the living and the dead
And We placed therein lofty firmly set mountains and have given you to drink sweet water
Woe that Day to the deniers
They will be told Proceed to that which you used to deny
Proceed to a shadow of smoke having three columns
But having no cool shade and availing not against the flame
Indeed it throws sparks as huge as a fortress
As if they were yellowish black camels
Woe that Day to the deniers
This is a Day they will not speak
Nor will it be permitted for them to make an excuse
Woe that Day to the deniers
This is the Day of Judgement We will have assembled you and the former peoples
So if you have a plan then plan against Me
Woe that Day to the deniers
Indeed the righteous will be among shades and springs
And fruits from whatever they desire
Being told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
Indeed We thus reward the doers of good
Woe that Day to the deniers
O disbelievers eat and enjoy yourselves a little indeed you are criminals
Woe that Day to the deniers
And when it is said to them Bow in prayer they do not bow
Woe that Day to the deniers
Then in what statement after the Qur an will they believe
About what are they asking one another
About the great news
That over which they are in disagreement
No They are going to know
Then no They are going to know
Have We not made the earth a resting place
And the mountains as stakes
And We created you in pairs
And made your sleep a means for rest
And made the night as clothing
And made the day for livelihood
And constructed above you seven strong heavens
And made therein a burning lamp
And sent down from the rain clouds pouring water
That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation
And gardens of entwined growth
Indeed the Day of Judgement is an appointed time
The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes
And the heaven is opened and will become gateways
And the mountains are removed and will be but a mirage
Indeed Hell has been lying in wait
For the transgressors a place of return
In which they will remain for ages unending
They will not taste therein any coolness or drink
Except scalding water and foul purulence
An appropriate recompense
Indeed they were not expecting an account
And denied Our verses with emphatic denial
But all things We have enumerated in writing
So taste the penalty and never will We increase you except in torment
Indeed for the righteous is attainment
Gardens and grapevines
And fullbreasted companions of equal age
And a full cup
No ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood
As reward from your Lord a generous gift made due by account
From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the Most Merciful
They possess not from Him authority for speech
The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows they will not speak except for one whom the Most Merciful permits and he will say what is correct
That is the True Day so he who wills may take to his Lord a way of return
Indeed We have warned you of a near punishment on the Day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth and the disbeliever will say Oh I wish that I were dust
By those angels who extract with violence
And by those who remove with ease
And by those who glide as if swimming
And those who race each other in a race
And those who arrange each matter
On the Day the blast of the Horn will convulse creation
There will follow it the subsequent one
Hearts that Day will tremble
Their eyes humbled
They are presently saying Will we indeed be returned to our former state of life
Even if we should be decayed bones
They say That then would be a losing return
Indeed it will be but one shout
And suddenly they will be alert upon the earth s surface
Has there reached you the story of Moses
When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
Go to Pharaoh
Indeed he has transgressed
And say to him Would you be willing to purify yourself
And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear Him
And he showed him the greatest sign
But Pharaoh denied and disobeyed
Then he turned his back striving
And he gathered his people and called out
And said I am your most exalted lord
So Allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first transgression
Indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear Allah
Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven Allah constructed it
He raised its ceiling and proportioned it
And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness
And after that He spread the earth
He extracted from it its water and its pasture
And the mountains He set firmly
As provision for you and your grazing livestock
But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity
The Day when man will remember that for which he strove
And Hellfire will be exposed for all those who see
So as for he who transgressed
And preferred the life of the world
Then indeed Hellfire will be his refuge
But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented the soul from unlawful inclination
Then indeed Paradise will be his refuge
They ask you O Muhammad about the Hour when is its arrival
In what position are you that you should mention it
To your Lord is its finality
You are only a warner for those who fear it
It will be on the Day they see it as though they had not remained in the world except for an afternoon or a morning thereof
The Prophet frowned and turned away
Because there came to him the blind man interrupting
But what would make you perceive O Muhammad that perhaps he might be purified
Or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him
As for he who thinks himself without need
To him you give attention
And not upon you is any blame if he will not be purified
But as for he who came to you striving for knowledge
While he fears Allah
From him you are distracted
No
Indeed these verses are a reminder
So whoever wills may remember it
It is recorded in honored sheets
Exalted and purified
Carried by the hands of messengerangels
Noble and dutiful
Cursed is man how disbelieving is he
From what substance did He create him
From a spermdrop He created him and destined for him
Then He eased the way for him
Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him
Then when He wills He will resurrect him
No Man has not yet accomplished what He commanded him
Then let mankind look at his food
How We poured down water in torrents
Then We broke open the earth splitting it with sprouts
And caused to grow within it grain
And grapes and herbage
And olive and palm trees
And gardens of dense shrubbery
And fruit and grass
As enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock
But when there comes the Deafening Blast
On the Day a man will flee from his brother
And his mother and his father
And his wife and his children
For every man that Day will be a matter adequate for him
Some faces that Day will be bright
Laughing rejoicing at good news
And other faces that Day will have upon them dust
Blackness will cover them
Those are the disbelievers the wicked ones
When the sun is wrapped up in darkness
And when the stars fall dispersing
And when the mountains are removed
And when fullterm shecamels are neglected
And when the wild beasts are gathered
And when the seas are filled with flame
And when the souls are paired
And when the girl who was buried alive is asked
For what sin she was killed
And when the pages are made public
And when the sky is stripped away
And when Hellfire is set ablaze
And when Paradise is brought near
A soul will then know what it has brought with it
So I swear by the retreating stars
Those that run their courses and disappear
And by the night as it closes in
And by the dawn when it breathes
That indeed the Qur an is a word conveyed by a noble messenger
Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne secure in position
Obeyed there in the heavens and trustworthy
And your companion is not at all mad
And he has already seen Gabriel in the clear horizon
And Muhammad is not a withholder of knowledge of the unseen
And the Qur an is not the word of a devil expelled from the heavens
So where are you going
It is not except a reminder to the worlds
For whoever wills among you to take a right course
And you do not will except that Allah wills Lord of the worlds
When the sky breaks apart
And when the stars fall scattering
And when the seas are erupted
And when the contents of graves are scattered
A soul will then know what it has put forth and kept back
O mankind what has deceived you concerning your Lord the Generous
Who created you proportioned you and balanced you
In whatever form He willed has He assembled you
No But you deny the Recompense
And indeed appointed over you are keepers
Noble and recording
They know whatever you do
Indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
And indeed the wicked will be in Hellfire
They will enter to burn therein on the Day of Recompense
And never therefrom will they be absent
And what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense
Then what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense
It is the Day when a soul will not possess for another soul power to do a thing and the command that Day is entirely with Allah
Woe to those who give less than due
Who when they take a measure from people take in full
But if they give by measure or by weight to them they cause loss
Do they not think that they will be resurrected
For a tremendous Day
The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds
No
Indeed the record of the wicked is in sijjeen
And what can make you know what is sijjeen
It is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
Woe that Day to the deniers
Who deny the Day of Recompense
And none deny it except every sinful transgressor
When Our verses are recited to him he says Legends of the former peoples
No
Rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning
No Indeed from their Lord that Day they will be partitioned
Then indeed they will enter and burn in Hellfire
Then it will be said to them This is what you used to deny
No
Indeed the record of the righteous is in illiyyun
And what can make you know what is illiyyun
It is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
Which is witnessed by those brought near to Allah
Indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
On adorned couches observing
You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure
They will be given to drink pure wine which was sealed
The last of it is musk
So for this let the competitors compete
And its mixture is of Tasneem
A spring from which those near to Allah drink
Indeed those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
And when they passed by them they would exchange derisive glances
And when they returned to their people they would return jesting
And when they saw them they would say Indeed those are truly lost
But they had not been sent as guardians over them
So Today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers
On adorned couches observing
Have the disbelievers not been rewarded this Day for what they used to do
When the sky has split open
And has responded to its Lord and was obligated to do so
And when the earth has been extended
And has cast out that within it and relinquished it
And has responded to its Lord and was obligated to do so
O mankind indeed you are laboring toward your Lord with great exertion and will meet it
Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand
He will be judged with an easy account
And return to his people in happiness
But as for he who is given his record behind his back
He will cry out for destruction
And enter to burn in a Blaze
Indeed he had once been among his people in happiness
Indeed he had thought he would never return to Allah
But yes
Indeed his Lord was ever of him Seeing
So I swear by the twilight glow
And by the night and what it envelops
And by the moon when it becomes full
That you will surely experience state after state
So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
And when the Qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate to Allah
But those who have disbelieved deny
And Allah is most knowing of what they keep within themselves
So give them tidings of a painful punishment
Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds
For them is a reward uninterrupted
By the sky containing great stars
And by the promised Day
And by the witness and what is witnessed
Cursed were the companions of the trench
Containing the fire full of fuel
When they were sitting near it
And they to what they were doing against the believers were witnesses
And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah the Exalted in Might the Praiseworthy
To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
And Allah over all things is Witness
Indeed those who have tortured the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire
Indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow
That is the great attainment
Indeed the vengeance of your Lord is severe
Indeed it is He who originates creation and repeats
And He is the Forgiving the Affectionate
Honorable Owner of the Throne
Effecter of what He intends
Has there reached you the story of the soldiers
Those of Pharaoh and Thamud
But they who disbelieve are in persistent denial
While Allah encompasses them from behind
But this is an honored Qur an
Inscribed in a Preserved Slate
By the sky and the night comer
And what can make you know what is the night comer
It is the piercing star
There is no soul but that it has over it a protector
So let man observe from what he was created
He was created from a fluid ejected
Emerging from between the backbone and the ribs
Indeed Allah to return him to life is Able
The Day when secrets will be put on trial
Then man will have no power or any helper
By the sky which returns rain
And by the earth which cracks open
Indeed the Qur an is a decisive statement
And it is not amusement
Indeed they are planning a plan
But I am planning a plan
So allow time for the disbelievers
Leave them awhile
Exalt the name of your Lord the Most High
Who created and proportioned
And who destined and then guided
And who brings out the pasture
And then makes it black stubble
We will make you recite O Muhammad and you will not forget
Except what Allah should will
Indeed He knows what is declared and what is hidden
And We will ease you toward ease
So remind if the reminder should benefit
He who fears Allah will be reminded
But the wretched one will avoid it
He who will enter and burn in the greatest Fire
Neither dying therein nor living
He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself
And mentions the name of his Lord and prays
But you prefer the worldly life
While the Hereafter is better and more enduring
Indeed this is in the former scriptures
The scriptures of Abraham and Moses
Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming event
Some faces that Day will be humbled
Working hard and exhausted
They will enter to burn in an intensely hot Fire
They will be given drink from a boiling spring
For them there will be no food except from a poisonous thorny plant
Which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger
Other faces that Day will show pleasure
With their effort they are satisfied
In an elevated garden
Wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech
Within it is a flowing spring
Within it are couches raised high
And cups put in place
And cushions lined up
And carpets spread around
Then do they not look at the camels how they are created
And at the sky how it is raised
And at the mountains how they are erected
And at the earth how it is spread out
So remind O Muhammad you are only a reminder
You are not over them a controller
However he who turns away and disbelieves
Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment
Indeed to Us is their return
Then indeed upon Us is their account
By the dawn
And by ten nights
And by the even number and the odd
And by the night when it passes
Is there not in all that an oath sufficient for one of perception
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Aad
With Iram who had lofty pillars
The likes of whom had never been created in the land
And with Thamud who carved out the rocks in the valley
And with Pharaoh owner of the stakes
All of whom oppressed within the lands
And increased therein the corruption
So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment
Indeed your Lord is in observation
And as for man when his Lord tries him and thus is generous to him and favors him he says My Lord has honored me
But when He tries him and restricts his provision he says My Lord has humiliated me
No
But you do not honor the orphan
And you do not encourage one another to feed the poor
And you consume inheritance devouring it altogether
And you love wealth with immense love
No
When the earth has been leveled pounded and crushed
And your Lord has come and the angels rank upon rank
And brought within view that Day is Hell that Day man will remember but what good to him will be the remembrance
He will say Oh I wish I had sent ahead some good for my life
So on that Day none will punish as severely as His punishment
And none will bind as severely as His binding of the evildoers
To the righteous it will be said O reassured soul
Return to your Lord wellpleased and pleasing to Him
And enter among My righteous servants
And enter My Paradise
I swear by this city Makkah
And you O Muhammad are free of restriction in this city
And by the father and that which was born of him
We have certainly created man into hardship
Does he think that never will anyone overcome him
He says I have spent wealth in abundance
Does he think that no one has seen him
Have We not made for him two eyes
And a tongue and two lips
And have shown him the two ways
But he has not broken through the difficult pass
And what can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass
It is the freeing of a slave
Or feeding on a day of severe hunger
An orphan of near relationship
Or a needy person in misery
And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion
Those are the companions of the right
But they who disbelieved in Our signs those are the companions of the left
Over them will be fire closed in
By the sun and its brightness
And by the moon when it follows it
And by the day when it displays it
And by the night when it covers it
And by the sky and He who constructed it
And by the earth and He who spread it
And by the soul and He who proportioned it
And inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness
He has succeeded who purifies it
And he has failed who instills it with corruption
Thamud denied their prophet by reason of their transgression
When the most wretched of them was sent forth
And the messenger of Allah Salih said to them Do not harm the shecamel of Allah or prevent her from her drink
But they denied him and hamstrung her
So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal upon all of them
And He does not fear the consequence thereof
By the night when it covers
And by the day when it appears
And by He who created the male and female
Indeed your efforts are diverse
As for he who gives and fears Allah
And believes in the best reward
We will ease him toward ease
But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need
And denies the best reward
We will ease him toward difficulty
And what will his wealth avail him when he falls
Indeed incumbent upon Us is guidance
And indeed to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first life
So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing
None will enter to burn therein except the most wretched one
Who had denied and turned away
But the righteous one will avoid it
He who gives from his wealth to purify himself
And not giving for anyone who has done him a favor to be rewarded
But only seeking the countenance of his Lord Most High
And he is going to be satisfied
By the morning brightness
And by the night when it covers with darkness
Your Lord has not taken leave of you O Muhammad nor has He detested you
And the Hereafter is better for you than the first life
And your Lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied
Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge
And He found you lost and guided you
And He found you poor and made you selfsufficient
So as for the orphan do not oppress him
And as for the petitioner do not repel him
But as for the favor of your Lord report it
Did We not expand for you O Muhammad your breast
And We removed from you your burden
Which had weighed upon your back
And raised high for you your repute
For indeed with hardship will be ease
Indeed with hardship will be ease
So when you have finished your duties then stand up for worship
And to your Lord direct your longing
By the fig and the olive
And by Mount Sinai
And by this secure city Makkah
We have certainly created man in the best of stature
Then We return him to the lowest of the low
Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for they will have a reward uninterrupted
So what yet causes you to deny the Recompense
Is not Allah the most just of judges
Recite in the name of your Lord who created
Created man from a clinging substance
Recite and your Lord is the most Generous
Who taught by the pen
Taught man that which he knew not
No But indeed man transgresses
Because he sees himself selfsufficient
Indeed to your Lord is the return
Have you seen the one who forbids
A servant when he prays
Have you seen if he is upon guidance
Or enjoins righteousness
Have you seen if he denies and turns away
Does he not know that Allah sees
No
If he does not desist We will surely drag him by the forelock
A lying sinning forelock
Then let him call his associates
We will call the angels of Hell
No
Do not obey him
But prostrate and draw near to Allah
Indeed We sent the Qur an down during the Night of Decree
And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree
The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months
The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter
Peace it is until the emergence of dawn
Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted from misbelief until there came to them clear evidence
A Messenger from Allah reciting purified scriptures
Within which are correct writings
Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence
And they were not commanded except to worship Allah being sincere to Him in religion inclining to truth and to establish prayer and to give zakah
And that is the correct religion
Indeed they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell abiding eternally therein
Those are the worst of creatures
Indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds those are the best of creatures
Their reward with Allah will be gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever Allah being pleased with them and they with Him
That is for whoever has feared his Lord
When the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
And the earth discharges its burdens
And man says What is wrong with it
That Day it will report its news
Because your Lord has commanded it
That Day the people will depart separated into categories to be shown the result of their deeds
So whoever does an atom s weight of good will see it
And whoever does an atom s weight of evil will see it
By the racers panting
And the producers of sparks when striking
And the chargers at dawn
Stirring up thereby clouds of dust
Arriving thereby in the center collectively
Indeed mankind to his Lord is ungrateful
And indeed he is to that a witness
And indeed he is in love of wealth intense
But does he not know that when the contents of the graves are scattered
And that within the breasts is obtained
Indeed their Lord with them that Day is fully Acquainted
The Striking Calamity
What is the Striking Calamity
And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity
It is the Day when people will be like moths dispersed
And the mountains will be like wool fluffed up
Then as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds
He will be in a pleasant life
But as for one whose scales are light
His refuge will be an abyss
And what can make you know what that is
It is a Fire intensely hot
Competition in worldly increase diverts you
Until you visit the graveyards
No
You are going to know
Then no
You are going to know
No If you only knew with knowledge of certainty
You will surely see the Hellfire
Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty
Then you will surely be asked that Day about pleasure
By time
Indeed mankind is in loss
Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience
Woe to every scorner and mocker
Who collects wealth and continuously counts it
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
No
He will surely be thrown into the Crusher
And what can make you know what is the Crusher
It is the fire of Allah eternally fueled
Which mounts directed at the hearts
Indeed Hellfire will be closed down upon them
In extended columns
Have you not considered O Muhammad how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant
Did He not make their plan into misguidance
And He sent against them birds in flocks
Striking them with stones of hard clay
And He made them like eaten straw
For the accustomed security of the Quraysh
Their accustomed security in the caravan of winter and summer
Let them worship the Lord of this House
Who has fed them saving them from hunger and made them safe saving them from fear
Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense
For that is the one who drives away the orphan
And does not encourage the feeding of the poor
So woe to those who pray
But who are heedless of their prayer
Those who make show of their deeds
And withhold simple assistance
Indeed We have granted you O Muhammad alKawthar
So pray to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone
Indeed your enemy is the one cut off
Say O disbelievers
I do not worship what you worship
Nor are you worshippers of what I worship
Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship
Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship
For you is your religion and for me is my religion
When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest
And you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes
Then exalt Him with praise of your Lord and ask forgiveness of Him
Indeed He is ever Accepting of repentance
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined and ruined is he
His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained
He will enter to burn in a Fire of blazing flame
And his wife as well the carrier of firewood
Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber
Say He is Allah who is One
Allah the Eternal Refuge
He neither begets nor is born
Nor is there to Him any equivalent
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak
From the evil of that which He created
And from the evil of darkness when it settles
And from the evil of the blowers in knots
And from the evil of an envier when he envies
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind
The Sovereign of mankind
The God of mankind
From the evil of the retreating whisperer
Who whispers evil into the breasts of mankind
From among the jinn and mankind
All praise belongs to God Lord of the Universe
the Beneficent the Merciful
and Master of the Day of Judgment
Lord You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance
Lord guide us to the right path
the path of those to whom You have granted blessings those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray
Alif Lam
There is no doubt that this book is a guide for the pious
the pious who believe in the unseen attend to prayer give in charity part of what We have granted them
who have faith in what has been revealed to you and others before you and have strong faith in the life hereafter
It is the pious who follow the guidance of their Lord and gain lasting happiness
Those who deny your message will not believe whether you warn them or not
God has sealed their hearts and hearing and their vision is veiled a great punishment awaits them
Some people say We believe in God and the Day of Judgment but they are not true believers
They deceive God and the believers However they have deceived no one but themselves a fact of which they are not aware
A sickness exists in their hearts to which God adds more sickness
Besides this they will suffer a painful punishment as a result of the lie which they speak
When they are told not to commit corruption in the land they reply We are only reformers
They certainly are corrupt but do not realize it
When they are told to believe as everyone else does they say Should we believe as fools do
In fact they themselves are fools but they do not know it
To the believers they declare belief and in secret to their own devils they say We were only mocking
God mocks them and gives them time to continue blindly in their transgressions
They have traded guidance for error but their bargain has had no profit and they have missed the true guidance
Their case is like that of one who kindles a fire and when it grows bright God takes away its light leaving him in darkness wherein he cannot see anything
They are deaf blind and dumb and cannot regain their senses
Or it is like that of a rain storm with darkness thunder and lightning approaching They cover their ears for fear of thunder and death
God encompasses those who deny His words
The lightning almost takes away their vision
When the lightning brightens their surroundings they walk and when it is dark they stand still
Had God wanted He could have taken away their hearing and their vision
God has power over all things
People worship your Lord who created you and those who lived before you so that you may become pious
Worship God who has rendered the earth as a floor for you and the sky as a dome for you and has sent water down from the sky to produce fruits for your sustenance
Do not knowingly set up anything as an equal to God
Should you have any doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant present one chapter comparable to it and call all your supporters besides God if your claim is true
If you do not produce such a chapter and you never will then guard yourselves against the fire whose fuel will be people and stones and is prepared for those who hide the Truth
Muhammad tell the righteously striving believers of the happy news that for them there are gardens wherein streams flow
Whenever they get any fruit from the gardens as food they will say This is just what we had before we came here
These fruits are produced very much like them those we had before
They will have purified spouses and it is they who will live forever
God does not hesitate to set forth parables of anything even a gnat
The believers know that it is the truth from their Lord but those who deny the truth say What does God mean by such parables
In fact by such parables God misleads and guides many
However He only misleads the evil doers
who break their established covenant with Him and the relations He has commanded to be kept and who spread evil in the land
These are the ones who lose a great deal
How dare you deny the existence of God Who gave you life when you initially had no life
He will cause you to die and bring you to life again Then you will return to His Presence
It is He who created everything on earth for you Then directing His order towards the realm above He turned it into seven heavens
He has knowledge of all things
When your Lord said to the angels I am appointing someone as my deputy on earth they said almost protesting Are you going to appoint one who will commit corruption and bloodshed therein even though we are the ones who commemorate Your Name and glorify You
The Lord said I know that which you do not know
He taught Adam all the names Then He introduced some intelligent beings to the angels asking them to tell Him the names of these beings if the angels were true to their claim that they more deserved to be His deputies on earth
The angels replied You are glorious indeed
We do not know more than what You have taught us
You alone are Allknowing and Allwise
The Lord said to Adam Tell the names of the beings to the angels
When Adam said their names the Lord said Did I not tell you angels that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth and all that you reveal or hide
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis Satan who abstained out of pride and so he became one of those who deny the truth
We told Adam to stay with his spouse Eve in the garden and enjoy the foods therein but not to go near a certain tree lest he become one of the transgressors
Satan made Adam and his spouse err and caused them to abandon the state in which they had been living
Then We said Descend you are each other s enemies
The earth will be a dwelling place for you and it will provide you with sustenance for an appointed time
Adam was inspired by some words of prayer through which he received forgiveness from his Lord for He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We ordered them all to get out of the garden and told them that when Our guidance came to them those who would follow it would have neither fear nor grief
But those who would deny the Truth and reject Our revelations would be the companions of the Fire in which they would live forever
Children of Israel recall My favors which you enjoyed Fulfill your covenant with Me and I shall fulfill Mine
Revere only Me
Believe in My revelations Quran that confirms what I revealed to you about Prophet Muhammad in your Scripture
Do not be the first ones to deny it nor sell My revelations for a small price but have fear of Me
Do not mix truth with falsehood and do not deliberately hide the truth
Be steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax zakat and bow down in worship with those who do the same
Would you order people to do good deeds and forget to do them yourselves even though you read the Book
Why do you not think
Help yourselves in your affairs with patience and prayer
It is a difficult task indeed but not for the humble ones
who are certain of their meeting with their Lord and their return to Him
Children of Israel recall My favors to you and the preference that I gave to you over all nations
Have fear of the day when every soul will be responsible for itself No intercession or ransom will be accepted and no one will receive help
Children of Israel recall My favor of saving you from the Pharaoh s people who afflicted you with the worst kind of cruelty slaying your sons and sparing your women
Your suffering was indeed a great trial from your Lord
We parted the sea to save you and drowned Pharaoh s people before your very eyes
Then We called Moses for an appointment of forty nights
You began to worship the calf in his absence doing wrong to yourselves
Afterwards We forgave you so that you would perhaps appreciate Our favors
We gave Moses the Book and the criteria of discerning right from wrong so that perhaps you would be rightly guided
Moses said to his people My people you have done wrong to yourselves by worshipping the calf
Seek pardon from your Lord and slay yourselves
He told them that it would be best for them in the sight of their Lord Who would forgive them for He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When you argued with Moses saying that you were not going to believe him unless you could see God with your own eyes the swift wind struck you and you could do nothing but watch
Then We brought you back to life in the hope that you might appreciate Our favors
We provided you with shade from the clouds and sent down manna and quails as the best pure sustenance for you to eat
They children of Israel did not wrong Us but wronged themselves
Children of Israel recall My favors when We told you Enter this city enjoy eating whatever you want therein prostrate yourselves and ask forgiveness when passing through the gate and We shall forgive your sins and add to the rewards of the righteous ones
The unjust ones among you changed what they were told to say Then We afflicted them with a torment from the heavens for their evil deeds
When Moses prayed for rain We told him to strike the rock with his staff
Thereupon twelve fountains gushed out of the rock and each tribe knew their drinking place
The Lord told them Eat and drink from God s bounties and do not abuse the earth with corruption
When you demanded Moses to provide you with a variety of food saying We no longer have patience with only one kind of food ask your Lord to grow green herbs cucumbers corn lentils and onions for us Moses replied Would you change what is good for what is worse Go to any town and you will get what you want Despised and afflicted with destitution they brought the wrath of God back upon themselves for they denied the evidence of the existence of God and murdered His Prophets without reason they were disobedient transgressors
However those who have become believers the Muslims and the Jews the Christians and the Sabaeans who believe in God and the Day of Judgment and strive righteously will receive their reward from the Lord and will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
Children of Israel recall when We made a covenant with you raised Mount Tur Sinai above you and told you to receive earnestly what We had given to you and bear it in mind so that you would protect yourselves against evil
Again you turned away
Had God s Grace and His Mercy not existed in your favor you would certainly have been lost
You certainly knew about those among you who were transgressors on the Sabbath
We commanded them Become detested apes
in order to set up an example for their contemporaries and coming generations and to make it a reminder for the pious
When Moses said to his people God commands you to sacrifice a cow they asked Are you mocking us
God forbid how would I be so ignorant said Moses
They demanded Ask your Lord to describe the kind of cow He wants us to slaughter
Moses explained It must be neither too old nor too young thus do whatever you are commanded to do
Moses then told them to do as they were ordered
They further demanded Moses to ask the Lord what color the cow has to be
Moses answered The Lord says that the cow must be yellow a beautiful yellow
They said We are confused about the cow for to us all cows look alike
Ask your Lord to tell us exactly what the cow looks like so that God willing we shall have the right description
Moses said The Lord says that it must not have even tilled the soil nor irrigated the fields and it must be free of blemishes and flaws
They said Now you have given us the right description
After almost failing to find it they slaughtered the cow
When you murdered someone each one of you tried to accuse others of being guilty
However God made public what you were hiding
We said Strike the person slain with some part of the cow
That is how God brings the dead to life and shows you His miracles so that you might have understanding
Thereafter your hearts turned as hard as rocks or even harder for some rocks give way to the streams to flow
Water comes out of some rocks when they are torn apart and others tumble down in awe before God
God does not ignore what you do
Do you the believers in truth desire the unbelievers to believe you
There was a group among them who would hear the word of God and understand it Then they would purposely misinterpret it
On meeting the believers they would declare belief but to each other they would say How would you against your own interests tell them believers about what God has revealed to you in the Bible of the truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad They will present it as evidence to prove you wrong before your Lord
Do you not realize it
Do they not know that God knows whatever they conceal or reveal
Some of them are illiterate and have no knowledge of the Book except for what they know from legends and fantasy
They are only relying on conjecture
Woe to those who write the Book themselves and say This is from God so that they may sell it for a small price
Woe unto them for what they have done and for what they have gained
They have said Hell fire will never harm us except for just a few days Muhammad ask them Have you made such agreements with God Who never breaks any of His agreements or you just ascribe to Him that which you do not know
There is no doubt that evil doers who are engulfed in sins are the companions of hell fire wherein they will live forever
As for the righteously striving believers they will be among the people of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We made a covenant with the children of Israel that they should not worship anyone except Me that they should serve their parents relatives orphans and the destitute that they should speak righteous words to people and that they should be steadfast in their prayers and pay the religious tax
But soon after you made this covenant all but a few of you broke it heedlessly
We made a covenant with you that you should not shed each other s blood or expel each other from your homeland
You accepted and bore witness to this covenant
yet you murdered each other and forced a number of your people out of their homeland helping each other to commit sin and to be hostile to one another
When you had expelled people from their homeland and later they had been made captives of other people you then paid their ransom thinking that it was a righteous deed
God forbade you to expel these people in the first place
Do you believe in one part of the Book and not in the other
Those who behave in this way shall reap disgrace in this world and severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection
God is not unaware of things that you do
They have traded the life hereafter in exchange for their worldly life
Their punishment will not be eased nor will they receive help
We gave the Book to Moses and made the Messengers follow in his path
To Jesus the son of Mary We gave the miracles and supported him by the Holy Spirit
Why do you arrogantly belie some Messengers and murder others whenever they have brought you messages that you dislike
They have said that their hearts cannot understand what you Muhammad say
God has condemned them for their denial of the Truth
There are a very few of them who have faith
When a Book came to them from God which confirms what is with them the fact of truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad in their Scripture and despite the fact that they had been praying for victory over the disbelievers by the help of the truthful Prophet they refuse to accept this book even though they know it to be the Truth
May God condemn those who hide the Truth
Evil is that for which they have sold their souls They have refused to accept God s revelations in rebellion against the servant of God whom He has by His Grace chosen to grant His message
They have brought upon themselves God s wrath in addition to the wrath that they had incurred upon themselves for their previous sins
The disbelievers will suffer a humiliating torment
When they are told to believe n God s revelations they reply We believe only in what God has revealed to us but they disbelieve His other true revelations even though these revelations confirms their own original Scripture
Muhammad ask them Why did you murder God s Prophets if you were true believers
Moses brought you certain miracles
Not very long after you began worshipping the calf which was nothing but senseless cruelty to yourselves
Children of Israel when We made a covenant with you raised Mount Tur Sinai above you and told you to receive devotedly what We had revealed to you and to listen to it you said that you had listened but you disobeyed
They denied the truth and became totally devoted and full of love for the calf
Muhammad tell these people If in fact you are true believers then what your faith commands you to do is evil
Muhammad tell them If your claim is true that the home with God in the everlasting life hereafter is for you alone you should have a longing for death
But they can never have a longing for death because of what they have done
God knows the unjust well
However you will find them the greediest of all men even more than the pagans for life
They would each gladly live for a thousand years but such a long life would not save them from the torment
God sees what they do
Muhammad tell the people whoever is an enemy to Gabriel who has delivered the Book to your heart as a guide and as joyful news to the believers
and as a confirmation of original Scripture and whoever is the enemy of God His angels His Messenger Gabriel and Michael should know that God is the enemy of those who hide the Truth
Muhammad We have given you enlightening authority Only the wicked sinners deny it
Why is it that every time they the Jews make a covenant some of them abandon it
Most of them do not even believe
When a Messenger of God came to them confirming the original revelation that they already had received a group of those who had the Scripture with them threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know anything about it
They followed the incantations that the devils used against the kingdom of Solomon
Solomon did not hide the truth but the devils did They taught magic to the people and whatever was revealed to the two angels Harut and Marut in Babylon
The two angels did not teach anything to anyone without saying Our case is a temptation for the people so do not hide the truth
People learned something from the two angels that could cause discord between a man and his wife
However they could harm no one except by the permission of God
In fact the people learned things that would harm them and render them no benefit
They knew very well that one who engaged in witchcraft would have no reward in the life hereafter
Would that they had known that they had sold their souls for that which is vile
Would that they had known that if they had embraced the faith and avoided evil they would have received better rewards from God
Believers do not address the Prophet as ra ina whereby the Jews in their own accent meant Would that you would never hear but call him unzurna meaning Please speak to us slowly so that we understand and then listen The unbelievers will face a painful torment
Muhammad the disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans do not like to see anything good revealed to you from your Lord
God reserves His mercy for whomever He chooses
The generosity of God is great
For whatever sign We change or eliminate or cause to recede into oblivion We bring forth a better sign one that is identical
Do you not know that God has power over all things
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God and that no one is your guardian or helper besides Him
Do you want to address the Prophet in the same manner in which Moses was addressed
Anyone who exchanges belief for disbelief has certainly gone down the wrong path
Once you have accepted the faith many of the People of the Book would love out of envy to turn you back to disbelief even after the Truth has become evident to them
Have forgiveness and bear with them until God issues His order
God has power over all things
Be steadfast in your prayer and pay the religious tax
You will receive a good reward from God for all your good works
God is Wellaware of what you do
They have said that no one can ever go to Paradise except the Jews or Christians but this is only what they hope
Ask them to prove that their claim is true
However one who accepts Islam in submission to God and does good will have his reward with God
Such people will have nothing to fear nor to grieve about
The Jews accuse the Christians of having no basis for their religion and the Christians accuse the Jews of having no basis for their religion even though both sides read the Scripture
The ignorant ones say the same thing
God will issue His decree about their dispute on the Day of Judgment
Who is more unjust than those who strive to destroy the mosques and prevent others from commemorating the Name of God therein who could not enter the mosques except with fear
They the unjust ones will be disgraced in this life and will receive great torment in the life hereafter
The East and the West belong to God Wherever you turn you are always in the presence of God
God is Munificent and Omniscient
They the People of the Book have said that God has taken for Himself a son
He is too glorious to have a son
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth All pray in obedience to Him
God is the Originator of the heavens and the earth
Whenever He decides to do anything He just commands it to exist and it comes into existence
The ignorant have asked Why does He not speak to us and why has no evidence come to show us that He exists
People before them had also asked such questions
They all think in the same way
We have already made the evidence very clear for those who have certainty
We have sent you Muhammad for a genuine purpose to proclaim glad news and warnings
You will not be blamed for the dwellers of blazing hell
The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you unless you follow their faith
Muhammad tell them that the guidance of God is the only true guidance
If you follow their wishes after all the knowledge that has come to you you will no longer have God as your guardian and helper
Those of the People of the Book who have received Our Book Quran and read it thoroughly believe in it Those who disbelieve the Book are certainly losers
Children of Israel recall My favor to you and the preference that I gave to you over all the other nations
Have fear of the day when every soul will be responsible for itself no ransom will be accepted for it no intercession will be of any benefit to it and no one will receive any help
When his Lord tested Abraham s faith by His words and he satisfied the test He said I am appointing you as the leader of mankind
Abraham asked Will this leadership also continue through my descendants
The Lord replied The unjust do not have the right to exercise My authority
We made the house in Mecca as a place of refuge and sanctuary for men
Adopt the place where Abraham stood as a place for prayer
We advised Abraham and Ishmael to keep My house clean for the pilgrims the worshippers and for those who bow down and prostrate themselves in worship
When Abraham prayed to the Lord saying Lord make this town a place of security and provide those in the town who believe in God and the Day of Judgement with plenty God replied I shall allow those who hide the truth to enjoy themselves for a while
Then I shall drive them into the torment of hell fire a terrible destination
While Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundation of the house they prayed Lord accept our labor
You are Allhearing and Allknowing
Lord make us good Muslims one who submits himself to God and from our descendants make a good Muslim nation
Teach us the rules of worship and accept our repentance You are Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Lord send to them our descendants a Messenger of their own who will recite to them Your revelations teach them the Book give them wisdom and purify them
You alone are the Majestic and the Most Wise
No one turns away from Abraham s Tradition except one who makes a fool of himself
To Abraham We have granted distinction in this world and in the life hereafter he will be among the righteous ones
When God commanded Abraham to submit he replied I have submitted myself to the Will of the Lord of the universe
Abraham left this legacy to his sons and in turn so did Jacob saying God has chosen this religion for you You must not leave this world unless you are a Muslim submitted to the will of the Lord of the Universe
Were you believers there when death approached Jacob
When he asked his sons Whom will you worship after my death
They replied We will worship your Lord the Lord of your fathers Abraham Ishmael and Isaac He is the only Lord and to Him we have submitted ourselves
That nation children of Abraham is gone
They have reaped what they sowed and the same applies to you
You are not responsible for their deeds
The Jews and the Christians have asked the Muslims to accept their faith to have the right guidance
Muhammad tell them We would rather follow the upright religion of Abraham who was not a pagan
Muslims say We believe in God and what He has revealed to us and to Abraham Ishmael Isaac and their descendants and what was revealed to Moses Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord
We make no distinction among them and to God we have submitted ourselves
If they have faith in all that you believe they will have the right guidance but if they turn away it would be for no reason other than their own malice God is a Sufficient defender for you against them He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Say Belief in God and following the guidance of Islam are God s means of purification for us
Islam is the baptism of God
No one is a better baptizer than He and we Muslims worship Him
Muhammad ask the People of the Book Why should you argue with us about God Who is our Lord as well as yours when we are sincere in our belief in God
Everyone will be responsible for his own deeds Do you People of the Book claim that Abraham Ishmael Isaac and their descendants were Jews or Christians
Ask them Who possesses greater knowledge you or God Who is more unjust than one who refuses to testify to the truth that God has given to him
That nation is gone they have reaped what they sowed and the same applies to you
You are not responsible for their deeds
Fools will soon say What has made them Muslims change the direction to which they had been facing during their prayers the qibla
Muhammad tell them Both the East and West belong to God and He guides whomever He wants to the right direction
We have made you true Muslims a moderate nation so that you could be an example for all people and the Prophet an example for you
The direction which you had been facing during your prayers the qibla was only made in order that We would know who would follow the Messenger and who would turn away
It was a hard test but not for those to whom God has given guidance
God did not want to make your previous prayers worthless God is Compassionate and Allmerciful
We certainly saw you Muhammad often turn your face to the sky so We shall instruct you to face a qibla that you will like
Muhammad during prayer turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Makkah
Muslims also wherever you are during your prayers turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque
The People of the Book certainly know that this command to change the qibla is truly from their Lord
God is not unaware of what they do
Even if you were to bring all kinds of authoritative proof to the People of the Book they still would not accept your qibla nor would you accept theirs nor would they accept each others Were you to follow their desires after all the knowledge that has come to you you would certainly have been one of the unjust
Those to whom We have given the Book Bible know you Muhammad just as a well as they know their sons
It is certain that some of them deliberately hide the truth
Never doubt that the essence of truth comes from your Lord
Every one pursues his goal
Compete with each other in performing good deeds
Wherever you are God will bring you all together
God has power over all things
Muhammad wherever you go turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Mecca
This is the truth from your Lord who is not unaware of what you do
Muhammad wherever you go turn your face to the Sacred Mosque and Muslims wherever you are turn your faces in the same direction so that no group of people except the unjust among them would have any reason against you and so that I may establish My commandments for your people to have proper guidance The unjust may criticize you but do not fear them fear only Me
As We have sent a Messenger from your own people to show you evidence about Me to purify you from sins to teach you the Book give you wisdom and instruct you in that which you did not know
therefore remember Me and I shall remember you
Thank Me and do not hide the truth about Me
Believers help yourselves in your affairs through patience and prayer God is with those who have patience
Do not consider those who are slain for the cause of God to be dead
They are alive but you are unaware of them
We shall test you through fear hunger loss of life property and crops
Muhammad give glad news to the people who have patience
and in difficulty say We are the servants of God and to Him we shall all return
It is they who will receive blessings and mercy from God and who follow the right guidance
Safa and Marwah names of two places in Mecca are reminders of God
It is no sin for one who visits the Sacred House in Mecca to walk seven times between Safa and Marwah
Whoever willingly does a good deed in obedience to God will find God Allknowing and Fully Appreciative
Those who hide the authoritative proofs and the guidance that We have revealed after it has been made clear for the People of the Book will be condemned by God and those who have the right to condemn
However I shall accept the repentance of those of them who repent for their sins reform their manners and preach the truth I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who deny My existence and die with such attitude will be subject to the condemnation of God the angels and all people
They will live condemned forever will have no relief from the torment and no attention will be paid to them
Our Lord is the only Lord There is no God but He the Beneficent and Merciful
The creation of the heavens and the earth the alternation of nights and days the ships that sail in the sea for the benefit of the people the water that God sends from the sky to revive the dead earth where He has scattered all kinds of animals the winds of all directions and the clouds rendered for service between the sky and the earth are all evidence of His existence for those who use their reason
Some people consider certain things equal to God and love them just as one should love God
However the strongest of the believers love is their love of God
Had the unjust been able to reflect about their condition when facing the torment they would have had no doubt that to God belongs Allpower and that He is stern in His retribution
When the leaders see the torment and lose all their resources they will denounce their followers
The followers will say Had we had the chance we also would have denounced our leaders
That is how God will show them their regrettable deeds They will not be able to escape from hell fire
People eat of the good and lawful things on earth
Do not follow the footsteps of Satan he is clearly your enemy
He tries to make you do evil and shameful things and speak against God without knowledge
When some people are asked to follow the revelations of God they say We would rather follow what our fathers have followed even though their fathers had no understanding and could not find the true guidance
Preaching to unbelievers is like talking to someone who cannot hear anything except yells and shouts
They are deaf dumb and blind they have no understanding
Believers eat from the good things that We have given you and give thanks to God if you worship only Him
God has forbidden you to eat that which has not been properly slaughtered blood pork and the flesh of any animal which has not been consecrated with a mention of the Name of God
However in an emergency without the intention of transgression or repeating transgression one will not be considered to have committed a sin
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who receive some small gain by hiding the Books which God has revealed have in fact filled up their stomachs with fire
God will not speak with them on the Day of Judgment nor will He purify them instead they will face a painful torment
They have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for torment
What makes them seek the fire so earnestly for they are doomed to be punished
God has revealed the Book in all Truth and those who dispute it are filled with malice which has taken them far away from the truth
Righteousness is not determined by facing East or West during prayer
Righteousness consists of the belief in God the Day of Judgment the angels the Books of God His Prophets to give money for the love of God to relatives orphans the destitute and those who are on a journey and in urgent need of money beggars to set free slaves and to be steadfast in prayer to pay the religious tax zakat to fulfill one s promises and to exercise patience in poverty in distress and in times of war
Such people who do these are truly righteous and pious
Believers in case of murder the death penalty is the sanctioned retaliation a free man for a free man a slave for a slave and a female for a female
However if the convicted person receives pardon from the aggrieved party the prescribed rules of compensation must be followed accordingly
This is a merciful alteration from your Lord
Whoever transgresses against it will face a painful punishment
People of understanding the law of the death penalty as retaliation grants you life so that perhaps you will have fear of God
If one of you facing death can leave a legacy he should bequeath it to his parents and relatives according to the law
This is the duty of the pious
Whoever intentionally changes the will of a deceased person he has committed a sin
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
One who is afraid of the testator s deviations and sin and settles the matter among the parties involved he has not committed a sin
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers fasting has been made mandatory for you as it was made mandatory for the people before you so that you may have fear of God
Fasting is only for a certain number of days
One who is sick or on a journey has to fast the same number of days at another time
Those who can afford a redemption should feed a poor person
Good deeds performed on one s own initiative will be rewarded However fasting is better and will be rewarded
Would that you knew this
The month of Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed a guide for the people the most authoritative of all guidance and a criteria to discern right from wrong
Anyone of you who knows that the month of Ramadan has begun he must start to fast Those who are sick or on a journey have to fast the same number of days at another time
God does not impose any hardship upon you He wants you to have comfort so that you may complete the fast glorify God for His having given you guidance and that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Muhammad if any of My servants ask you about Me tell them that the Lord says I am near I accept the prayers of those who pray Let My servants answer My call and believe in Me so that perhaps they may know the right direction
It is made lawful for you during the nights of fasting to have carnal relations with your wives
They are your garments and you are their garments
God knew that you were deceiving yourselves He relented towards you and forgave you
Now it is lawful for you to have carnal relations with your wives and follow what God has commanded Eat and drink until the white streak of dawn becomes distinguishable from darkness
Complete your fast starting from dawn to dusk It is not lawful to have carnal relations with your wives during i tikaf in the mosque
Do not come close to transgressing them Thus has God explained His evidence to men so that perhaps they will have fear of God
Do not use your property among yourselves in illegal ways and then deliberately bribe the rulers with your property so that you may wrongly acquire the property of others
Muhammad they ask you about the different phases of the moon Tell them that they are there to indicate to people the phases of time and the pilgrimage season
It is not a righteous act to enter houses from the back
Righteousness is to be pious and enter the houses from the front door
Have fear of God so that perhaps you will have lasting happiness
Fight for the cause of God those who fight you but do not transgress for God does not love the transgressors
Slay them wherever you may catch them and expel them from the place from which they expelled you
The sin of disbelief in God is greater than committing murder
Do not fight them in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca unless they start to fight
Then slay them for it is the recompense that the disbelievers deserve
If they give up disbelief and fighting God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Fight them so that there will be no disbelief in God and God s religion will become dominant If they change their behavior there would be no hostility against anyone except the unjust
It is because of their disrespect of a sacred month that you are also allowed to retaliate against them in a sacred month
If any one transgresses against you you also may retaliate against them to an equal extent
Have fear of God and know that He supports the pious
Give money for the cause of God but do not push yourselves into perdition
Do good God loves the people who do good deeds
Complete the hajj and umrah two parts of the rituals of pilgrimage to Makka in obedience to God If you are prevented from completing the duty of hajj offer whatever sacrifice is possible and do not shave your heads before the sacrificial animal is delivered to the prescribed place
If one of you is ill or is suffering because of some ailment in your head you must redeem the shaving of the head by fasting or paying money or offering a sheep as a sacrifice
When all is well with you and you want to complete the umrah in the hajj season offer whatever sacrifice is possible
If you do not find an animal you have to fast for three days during the days of the pilgrimage rituals and seven days at home to complete the required ten fasting days
This rule is for those who live beyond a distance of twelve miles from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca
Have fear of God and know that He is stern in His retribution
The months of the hajj pilgrimage season are well known
Whoever undertakes to complete the hajj rituals must know that after commencing the acts of Hajj he is not allowed to have carnal relations or to lie or to swear by the Name of God
God knows all your good deeds
Supply yourselves for the journey
The best supply is piety
People of understanding have fear of Me
It is not a sin if you try to make a profit out of the bounty of your Lord by trading during hajj
When you leave Arafah commemorate the name of your Lord in Mash ar the sacred reminder of God
Commemorate His name as He has given you guidance while prior to that you had been in error
Then leave Mash ar as the rest of the people do and ask forgiveness from God He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
After you complete the acts of your Hajj also commemorate God just as you would remember your father or even more earnestly
Some people say Lord give us what we want in this life but in the life hereafter they have no beneficial share
Others pray Lord give us good things both in this life as well as in the life hereafter and save us from the torment of fire
They will have their share of the reward for their deeds
God s reckoning is swift
Commemorate the names of God in the prescribed days
For one who observes piety it is not a sin to be hasty or tardy during the two days
Have fear of God and know that before Him you will all be raised after death
There are some people whose words about this life may please you
They say that God knows what they have in their hearts
But in fact they are the most quarrelsome opponents
As soon as they leave you they quickly commit evil in the land destroying the farms and people
God does not love evil
When they are asked to have fear of God sinful pride prevents them from paying heed to such advice
It is enough for them to have hell as a terrible dwelling place
There are those among people who give their lives to seek God s pleasure
God is Affectionate to His servants
Believers submit yourselves to the will of God as a whole
Do not follow the footsteps of Satan he is your sworn enemy
If you are seduced after you have received the authoritative guidance know that God is Majestic and Wise
Have they decided not to believe until God comes down in a shadow of clouds with the angels so that then the matter is settled
To God do all matters return
Muhammad ask the children of Israel about how many visible miracles We had shown them
God is certainly stern in His retribution to those who change the bounty of God His revelation after having received His guidance
The worldly life is made to seem attractive to the disbelievers who scoff at the faithful but the pious in the life hereafter will have a position far above them
God grants sustenance without account to anyone He wants
At one time all people were only one nation
God sent Prophets with glad news and warnings He sent the Book with them for a genuine purpose to provide the people with the ruling about disputed matters among them
No one disputed this matter except those who had already received evidence before Their dispute was only because of their own hostility
To deal with this dispute God through His will sent guidance to the believers
God guides to the right path whomever He wants
Would you think that you could go to Paradise without experiencing the kind of suffering others have experienced before you
Distress and afflictions battered them until the Messenger and the believers said When will God send help
Certainly God s help is near
They ask you what to spend for the cause of God Muhammad tell them that whatever you spend give it to your parents the orphans the destitute and those who may be in urgent need of money whilst on a journey
Whatever good you do God certainly is Aware of it
Fighting is made mandatory for you but you dislike it
You may not like something which in fact is for your good and something that you may love in fact may be evil
God knows but you do not know
Muhammad they ask you about fighting in the sacred month
Tell them that it is a great sin However creating an obstacle in the way of God disbelief in Him and the Sacred Mosque and driving away the neighbors of the Sacred Mosque is an even greater sin in the sight of God Disbelief in God is worse than committing murder
The pagans still try to fight you to make you give up your religion
The deeds in this life of those of you who give up their religion and who die disbelievers will be made void and in the life hereafter
These people will be the dwellers of Hell wherein they will remain forever
The believers and the Emigrants from Mecca who fight for the cause of God indeed have hope in receiving the mercy of God God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad they ask you about wine and gambling Tell them that there is great sin in them
Although they have benefits for men the sin therein is far greater than the benefit
They ask you about what they should give for the cause of God Tell them Let it be what you can spare
This is how God explains for you His guidance so that perhaps you will think
about this life and the life hereafter
They ask you about the orphans Tell them The best thing to do is what is for their good
They are your brethren if you would associate with them
God knows who is corrupt or a reformer
Had God wanted He would have brought upon you hardship
God is Majestic and Allwise
Do not marry pagan women unless they believe in God
A believing slave girl is better than an idolater even though the idolaters may attract you
Do not marry pagan men unless they believe in God
A believing slave is better than an idolater even though the idolater may attract you
The pagans invite you to the fire but God invites you to Paradise and forgiveness through His will God shows His evidence to people so that they may take heed
They ask you about women s menses Tell them It is an ailment
Avoid having carnal relations with them until their period is over Then you may have carnal relations with them according to the rules of God
God loves those who repent and those who purify themselves
Your wives are as fields for you
You may enter your fields from any place you want
Reserve something good for your souls for the life hereafter
Have fear of God and know that you are going to meet Him
Muhammad give the glad news to the believers
Do not swear by God not to do good things or have piety or make peace among people
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
God will not take into account your inattentive oath However He will question you about what your hearts have gained
God is Allforgiving and Lenient
Those who swear by God not to ever have any carnal relations with their wives will not be punished if they decide to resume marital relations again within four months God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If they choose divorce God is Allhearing and Allknowing
The divorced women must wait up to three menstrual cycles before another marriage
If they believe in God and the Day of Judgment it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs
Within their waiting period their husbands have the right to resume marital relations if they want reconciliation
Women have benefits as well as responsibilities
Men have a status above women
God is Majestic and Wise
A marital relation can only be resumed after the first and second divorce otherwise it must be continued with fairness or terminated with kindness
It is not lawful for you to take back from women what you have given them unless you are afraid of not being able to observe God s law
In this case it would be no sin for her to pay a ransom to set herself free from the bond of marriage
These are the laws of God
Do not transgress against them those who do so are unjust
After a divorce for the third time it is not lawful for the husband to resume marital relations with her or remarry her until she has been married and divorced by another husband In that case there is no sin for the former husband to marry her if they both think that they can abide by the law
These are the laws of God He explains them for the people of knowledge
When you divorce your wives and their waiting period has almost ended you may resume marital relations with honor or leave them with kindness
Do not force them to live with you in suffering to satisfy your hostility
Whoever commits such transgressions he has only harmed himself
Do not make jest of God s words
Remember the favors that God has done to you and the Book and wisdom He has revealed for your guidance
Have fear of God and know that God has knowledge of all things
When the waiting period of the divorced women has ended you her relatives must not prevent them from marrying their previous husbands again if they might reach an honorable agreement
This is an advice for those of you who believe in God and the Day of Judgment
It is the most beneficial and pure way of treating each other
God knows but you do not know
Mothers will breast feed their babies for two years if the fathers want them to complete this term
The father has to pay them reasonable expenses
No soul is responsible for what is beyond its ability
None of the parents should suffer any loss from the other because of the baby
The heirs are responsible to look after the children of a deceased
It is no sin for the parents to have a mutual agreement about weaning the baby
There is no sin in hiring a woman to breast feed your children for a reasonable payment
Have fear of God and know that God is well aware of what you do
The wives of those of you who die have to wait for a period of four months and ten days
After this appointed time it is no sin for the relatives of the deceased to let the widows do what is reasonable
God knows well what you do
It is not a sin if you make an indirect marriage proposal or have such an intention in your hearts
God knows that you will cherish their memories in your hearts
Do not have secret dates unless you behave lawfully
Do not decide for a marriage before the appointed time is over
Know that God knows what is in your hearts
Have fear of Him and know that He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Also it is not a sin if you divorce your wives before the consummation of the marriage or the fixing of the dowry But the dowry will be due from a husband whether he is rich or poor
It is payable in a reasonable amount according to the husband s financial ability This is an obligation for the righteous ones
If you divorce your wives before the consummation of the marriage and the amount of dowry has been fixed pay your wives half of the amount of their dowry unless she or her guardians drop their demand for payment
To drop such a demand is closer to piety
Be generous to each other
God is WellAware of what you do
Pay due attention to your prayers especially the middle prayer and stand up while praying in obedience to God
In an emergency you may say your prayers while walking or riding but when you are safe remember God as He has taught you what you did not know before
Those who are about to die and leave widows behind should bequeath for their wives the expenses of one year s maintenance The widows must not be expelled from the house for up to one year
It is no sin for the relatives of the deceased to permit the widows to leave the house before the appointed time and do what is reasonable
God is Majestic and Wise
The divorced women have the right to receive reasonable provisions It is an obligation for the pious
Thus does God explain His revelations to you so that perhaps you will have understanding
Muhammad consider the thousands who left their homes for fear of death who were then caused by God to die and brought back to life
God is generous to men but most people are not grateful
Fight for the cause of God and know that God is Allhearing and Allknowing
One who generously lends to God will be paid back in many multiples of the loan
It is God who reduces and expands things and to Him you will all return
Muhammad remember that group of the Israelites after Moses who demanded a Prophet of their own to appoint a king for them who would lead them in the fight for the cause of God
Their Prophet then said What if you are ordered to fight and you disobey
They said Why should we not fight for the cause of God when we and our sons have been expelled from our homes
However when they were ordered to fight all refused except a few among them
God knows well the unjust
Their Prophet said God has appointed Saul as a king for you
They replied How can he dominate us when we deserve more to be king than he Besides he does not have abundant wealth
Their Prophet said God has chosen him as your ruler and has given him physical power and knowledge
God grants His authority to anyone whom He wants
God is Provident and Allknowing
Their Prophet further told them As the evidence of his authority he will bring to you the Ark which will be a comfort to you from your Lord and a legacy of the household of Moses and Aaron
It will be carried by the angels
This is the evidence for you if you have faith
When Saul set forth with the army he said God will test you with a river
Those who drink its water will not be of my people and those who do not even taste the water or who only taste some of it from within the hollow of their hand will be my friends
They all drank the water except a few of them
When Saul and those who believed in him crossed the river his people said We do not have the strength to fight against Goliath and his army
Those who thought that they would meet God said How often with God s permission have small groups defeated the large ones
God is with those who exercise patience
Advancing towards Goliath and his army they prayed to God for patience steadfastness in battle and for victory over the unbelievers
They defeated their enemy through God s will
David slew Goliath and God granted David the kingdom and wisdom and also taught him whatever He wanted
Had God not made one group of people repel the other the earth would have become full of corruption but God is generous to His creatures
Muhammad these are the revelations which We recite to you for a genuine purpose
Certainly you are one of Our Messengers
We gave some of Our Messengers preference over others
To some of them God spoke and He raised the rank of some others
We gave authoritative proofs to Jesus son of Mary and supported him by the Holy Spirit
Had God wanted the generations who lived after those Messengers would not have fought each other after the authority had come to them
But they differed among themselves some of them believed in the authority and others denied it
They would not have fought each other had God wanted but God does as He wills
Believers out of what We have given you spend for the cause of God before the coming of the day when there will be no trading no friendship and no intercession
Those who deny the Truth are unjust
God exists
There is no God but He the Everlasting and the Guardian of life
Drowsiness or sleep do not seize him
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
No one can intercede with Him for others except by His permission
He knows about people s present and past
No one can grasp anything from His knowledge besides what He has permitted them to grasp
The heavens and the earth are under His dominion
He does not experience fatigue in preserving them both
He is the Highest and the Greatest
There is no compulsion in religion
Certainly right has become clearly distinct from wrong
Whoever rejects the devil and believes in God has firmly taken hold of a strong handle that never breaks
God is Allhearing and knowing
God is the Guardian of the believers and it is He who takes them out of darkness into light
The Devil is the guardian of those who deny the Truth and he leads them from light to darkness
These are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever
Muhammad have you heard about the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord for His granting him authority
Abraham said It is only my Lord who gives life and causes things to die His opponent said I also can give life and make things die
Abraham said God causes the sun to come up from the East You make it come from the West
Thus the unbeliever was confounded God does not guide the unjust people
Or have you heard of the one who on passing through an empty and ruined town said When will God bring it to life
God caused him to die and brought him back to life after a hundred years and then asked him How long have you been here
He replied One day or part of a day
The Lord said No you have been here for one hundred years Look at your food and drink
They have not yet decayed
But look at your donkey and its bones
To make your case evidence of the Truth for the people see how we bring the bones together and cover them with flesh
When he learned the whole story he said Now I know that God has power over all things
When Abraham prayed Lord show me how you bring the dead back to life the Lord said Do you not yet believe
Abraham replied I believe but want more confidence for my heart
God told him Take four birds induce them to come to you cut and scatter their bodies leaving parts on every mountain top then call them and they will swiftly come to you
Know that God is Majestic and Wise
Spending money for the cause of God is as the seed from which seven ears may grow each bearing one hundred grains
God gives in multiples to those whom He wants
God is Munificent and Allknowing
Those who spend their property for the cause of God and do not make the recipient feel obliged or insulted shall receive their reward from God
They will have no fear nor will they be grieved
Instructive words and forgiveness are better than charity that may cause an insult to the recipient
God is Rich and Forbearing
Believers do not make your charities fruitless by reproachfully reminding the recipient of your favor or making them feel insulted like the one who spends his property to show off and who has no faith in God or belief in the Day of Judgment
The example of his deed is as though some soil has gathered on a rock and after a rain fall it turns hard and barren
Such people can not benefit from what they have earned
God does not guide the unbelievers
The example of those who spend their property to please God out of their firm and sincere intention is as the garden on a fertile land which after a heavy rainfall or even a drizzle yields double produce
God is WellAware of what you do
What do you think of the case of one of you who wishes to have a garden of palmtrees and grapes with water flowing therein and producing all kinds of fruits especially if he is well advanced in age and has weak children who need support and then a hurricane with fire in it strikes the garden and burns it to the ground
This is how God explains to you His evidence so that you may think
Believers spend for the cause of God from the good things that you earn and from what we have made the earth yield for you
Do not even think of spending for the cause of God worthless things that you yourselves would be reluctant to accept
Know that God is Selfsufficient and Glorious
Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to commit sin
God promises you forgiveness and favors
God is Munificent and Allknowing
God gives wisdom to anyone whom He wants
Whoever is given wisdom certainly has received much good
Only people of reason can grasp this
God knows all about whatever you spend for His cause or any vows that you make The unjust people have no helper
It is not bad to give alms in public However if you give them privately to the poor it would be better for you and an expiation for some of your sins
God is WellAware of what you do
Muhammad you do not have to guide them
God guides whomever He wants
Whatever you spend for the cause of God is for your own good provided you do not spend anything but to please God
For anything good that you may give for the cause of God you will receive sufficient reward and no injustice will be done to you
If the recipients of charity are the poor whose poverty because of their striving for the cause of God has become an obstacle for them and who do not have the ability to travel in the land they seem rich compared to the ignorant because of their modest behavior
You would know them by their faces
They would never earnestly ask people for help
God knows well whatever wealth you spend for the cause of God
Those who spend their property for the cause of God any time during the day or night in public or in private will receive their reward from their Lord
There will be no fear for them nor will they grieve
Those who take unlawful interest will stand before God on the Day of Judgment as those who suffer from a mental imbalance because of Satan s touch they have said that trade is just like unlawful interest
God has made trade lawful and has forbidden unlawful interest
One who has received advice from his Lord and has stopped committing sins will be rewarded for his previous good deeds
His affairs will be in the hands of God
But one who turns back to committing sins will be of the dwellers of hell wherein he will live forever
God makes unlawful interest devoid of all blessings and causes charity to increase
God does not love sinful unbelievers
The righteously striving believers who are steadfast in their prayers and pay the zakat will receive their reward from God
They will have no fear nor will they grieve
Believers have fear of God and give up whatever unlawful interest you still demand from others if you are indeed true believers
If you will not give up the unlawful interest which you demand know that you are in the state of war with God and His Messenger
But if you repent you will have your capital without being wronged or having done wrong to others
One who faces hardship in paying his debts must be given time until his financial condition improves
Would that you knew that waiving such a loan as charity would be better for you
Safeguard yourselves against the day when you will return to God and every soul will be rewarded according to its deeds without being wronged
Believers if you take a loan for a known period of time have a just scribe write it down for you
The scribe should not refuse to do this as God has taught him
The debtor should dictate without any omission and have fear of God his Lord
If the debtor is a fool a minor or one who is unable to dictate his guardian should act with justice as his representative
Let two men or one man and two women whom you choose bear witness to the contract so that if one of them makes a mistake the other could correct him
The witness must not refuse to testify when their testimony is needed
Do not disdain writing down a small or a large contract with all the details
A written record of the contract is more just in the sight of God more helpful for the witness and a more scrupulous way to avoid doubt
However if everything in the contract is exchanged at the same time there is no sin in not writing it down
Let some people bear witness to your trade contracts but the scribe or witness must not be harmed it is a sin to harm them
Have fear of God
God teaches you
He has knowledge of all things
If you are on a journey where you cannot find a scribe finalize your contract in the form of a deposit in which the goods are already given to the parties If you trust each other in such a contract let him pay back what he has entrusted you with and have fear of God his Lord
Do not refuse to testify to what you bore witness
Whoever does so has committed a sin
God knows what you do
God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
God will call you to account for all that you may reveal from your souls and all that you may conceal
God will forgive or punish whomever He wants
God has power over all things
The Messengers and the believers have faith in what was revealed to them from their Lord
Everyone of them believed in God His angels His Books and His Messengers saying We find no difference among the Messengers of God
They also have said We heard God s commands and obeyed them
Lord we need Your forgiveness and to You we shall return
God does not impose on any soul a responsibility beyond its ability
Every soul receives whatever it gains and is liable for whatever it does
Lord do not hold us responsible for our forgetfulness and mistakes
Lord do not lay upon us the burden that You laid on those who lived before us
Lord do not lay on us what we cannot afford
Ignore and forgive our sins
Have mercy on us You are our Lord
Help us against the unbelievers
Alif Lam
God exists He is the only Lord the Everlasting and the Guardian of life
He has sent the Book Quran to you Muhammad in all Truth It confirms the original Bible
He revealed the Torah and the Gospel
before as a guide for the people and now He has revealed the criteria of discerning right from wrong
Those who reject the revelations of God will face the most severe torment
God is Majestic and capable to revenge
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from God
It is God who shapes you in the wombs as He wills
He is the only Lord the Majestic and Allwise
It is God who has revealed the Book to you in which some verses are clear statements which accept no interpretation and these are the fundamental ideas of the Book while other verses may have several possibilities
Those whose hearts are perverse follow the unclear statements in pursuit of their own mischievous goals by interpreting them in a way that will suit their own purpose
No one knows its true interpretations except God and those who have a firm grounding in knowledge say We believe in it
All its verses are from our Lord No one can grasp this fact except the people of reason
They say Lord do not cause our hearts to deviate from Your guidance and grant us mercy
You are the Most Awarding One
Lord it is certain that one day You will gather all the people together
God does not break His promise
The wealth and children of the unbelievers will never serve them as a substitute for their belief in God
Such people will be the fuel for the fire
They do as the people of Pharaoh and those who lived before them did
They called Our revelations mere lies
God punished them for their sins
God is stern in His retribution
Muhammad tell the unbelievers that they will soon be defeated and driven into Hell a terrible dwelling
There certainly is evidence of the existence of God for you in the case of the two armies
One of them fought for the cause of God
The other were disbelievers
The disbelievers appeared to be twice the size of the believers
However God supports through His help whomever He wants
It is a good lesson for the people of true vision
Worldly desires wives children accumulated treasures of gold and silver horses of noble breed cattle and farms are all made to seem attractive to men
All these are the bounties of the worldly life but in the life to come God has the best place for people to dwell
Muhammad ask them Shall I tell you what is far superior to worldly pleasures
Those who have fear of God will have as their reward gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever with their purified spouses and with the consent of God
God knows all about His servants
Such will be the reward of those who say Lord we have believed in you Forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of fire
who exercise patience speak the truth who are devoted in prayer spend their property for the cause of God and seek forgiveness from God during the last part of the night
God Himself testifies that He is the only Lord
The angels and the men of knowledge and justice testify that God is the only Lord the Majestic and Allwise
In the sight of God Islam is the religion
The People of the Book created differences in the matters of religion because of their hostility among themselves only after knowledge had come to them
Let whoever denies the revelations of God know that the reckoning of God is swift
Muhammad if the People of the Book argue against you say I and those who follow me have submitted ourselves to God
Ask the People of the Book and the illiterate ones Have you embraced Islam
If they embrace Islam they will find guidance but if they turn away your task is just to preach
God knows all about His servants
Warn those who deny the revelations of God and unjustly slay the Prophets and those who call people to be just that they will suffer a painful torment
The deeds of such people are made devoid of all virtue in both this life and the life to come There will be no one to help them
Muhammad consider those who have received a share of the Book
When they refer to the Book in order to judge amongst themselves a group of them turn away with disregard
because of their belief that the fire will only touch them for a few days
This fabricated belief has deceived them in matters of their religion
What will happen to their belief when We bring them together on the Inevitable Day when every soul will be justly recompensed for its deeds
Muhammad say Lord Owner of the Kingdom You give authority to whomever You want and take it away from whomever You want
You give honor to whomever You want and humiliate whomever You want
In Your hands is all virtue and You have power over all things
You cause the day to enter into the night and the night to enter into the day
You cause the living to come out of the dead and the dead to come out of the living
You give sustenance to whomever You want without keeping an account
The believers must not establish friendship with the unbelievers in preference to the faithful
Whoever does so has nothing to hope for from God unless he does it out of fear or taqiyah pious dissimulation
God warns you about Himself
To God do all things return
Muhammad tell them God knows all that you may conceal in your hearts or you may reveal
He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
He has power over all things
On the day when every soul will see its good and bad deeds right before its very eyes it will wish for the longest period of time to separate it from its bad deeds
God warns you about Himself God is Compassionate to His servants
Muhammad tell them If you love God follow me God will love you and forgive your sins
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Tell them Obey God and the Messenger
If they turn away let it be known that God does not love the unbelievers
God chose and gave distinction to Adam Noah the family of Abraham and Imran over all the people of the world
They were the offspring of one another
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Remember when Imran s wife prayed to her Lord saying I have made a vow to dedicate to Your service whatever is in my womb
Lord accept it from me
You are Allhearing and Allknowing
When the baby was born she said Lord it is a female
God knew this
Male and female are not alike I have named her Mary
I pray that You will keep her and her offspring safe from Satan the condemned one
Her Lord graciously accepted the offer and made Mary grow up pure and beautiful Zachariah took custody of her
Whenever he went to visit her in her place of worship he would find with her some food
He would ask her Where did this food come from She would reply God has sent it
God gives sustenance to whomever He wants without keeping an account
Zachariah prayed to his Lord there saying Lord grant me by Your Grace virtuous offspring
You hear all prayers
When he was standing during prayer in his place of worship the angels called him saying God gives you the glad news of the birth of your son John who will be a confirmation of Jesus the Word of God He will become a chaste noble leader and one of the righteous Prophets
He said How can there be a son for me when I am already senile and my wife is barren
The angel replied God does as He wills
Zachariah prayed to God saying Lord show me the evidence that it is Divine revelation The Lord replied You must not speak to people for three days except with gestures
Commemorate your Lord often and glorify Him in the early mornings and the evenings
Behold the angels told Mary God had chosen you purified you and given you distinction over all women
Mary pray devotedly to your Lord prostrate yourself before Him and bow down with those who bow down before Him
Muhammad that was some of the news about the unseen that We have revealed to you
You were not among those who cast lots by throwing their arrows to find out who would take custody of Mary nor were you among those who disputed the matter
Behold the angels told Mary God has given you the glad news of the coming birth of a son whom He calls His Word whose name will be Messiah Jesus son of Mary who will be a man of honor in this life and the life to come and who will be one of the ones nearest to God
He will speak to the people while in his cradle and preach to them when he will be a man He will be one of the righteous ones
Mary said How can there be a son for me when no mortal has touched me The angel replied That is how God creates whatever He wants
When He decides to do something He just orders it to exist and it comes into existence
God will give Jesus wisdom and teach him the Book the Torah and the Gospel
He will be a Messenger of God to the Israelites to whom he will say I have brought you a miracle from your Lord
I can create for you something from clay in the form of a bird
When I blow into it it will become a real bird by the permission of God
I can heal the blind and the lepers and bring the dead back to life by the permission of God
I can tell you about what you eat and what you store in your homes
This is a miracle for you if you want to have faith
I testify to what is true in the Torah and make lawful for you some of the things that were made unlawful I have brought you a miracle from your Lord
Have fear of God and obey me
God is my Lord as well as yours
Worship Him for this is the right path
When Jesus found them denying the truth he said Who will help me in the cause of God
The disciples replied We are the helpers of God
We believe in Him
Jesus bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to His will
They prayed Lord we have believed in what You have revealed to Your Messenger and we have followed him
Write down our names with those who testify in support of the Truth
The unbelievers plotted and God planned but God is a much better planner
He told Jesus I will save you from your enemies raise you to Myself keep you clean from the association with the disbelievers and give superiority to your followers over the unbelievers until the Day of Judgment
On that day you will all return to Me and I shall resolve your dispute
I shall sternly punish the unbelievers in this life and in the life to come and no one will help them
However to the righteously striving believers I shall give their reward in full measure
God does not love the unjust
Muhammad what we recite to you are revelations and words of wisdom
To God the case of Jesus is as that of Adam whom He created from the earth and then said Exist and Adam came into existence
Muhammad the essence of the Truth is from your Lord
Never have any doubt about it
If anyone disputes your prophesy after knowledge has come to you say Let each of us bring our children women our people and ourselves to one place and pray to God to condemn the liars among us
This is the true story of Jesus
There is no Lord but God
It is God who is Majestic and Allwise
If they turn away from the Truth let it be known that God knows well the evildoers
Muhammad say to the People of the Book We must come to a common term
Let us worship no one except God nor consider anything equal to Him nor regard any of us as our Lord besides God
However if they turn away from the Truth tell them Bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to the will of God
Ask the People of the Book Why do you argue about Abraham
The Torah and Gospel were revealed only after him Why do you not understand
You even argue about what is already known to you What can you learn from arguing about that which you have no knowledge
God knows but you do not know
Abraham was not a Jew or a Christian
He was an upright person who had submitted himself to the will of God Abraham was not a pagan
The nearest people to Abraham among mankind are those who followed him this Prophet Muhammad and the true believers
God is the Guardian of the true believers
A group among the People of the Book would love to mislead you but they mislead no one but themselves However they do not realize it
Muhammad say People of the Book why do you deny the revelation of God the Quran even though you know very well that it is from God
Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly hide the truth
Some of the People of the Book say Believe in what is revealed to the Muslims during the day only and abandon it in the evening
This will perhaps make them give up their religion
They also say Do not believe anyone except those who follow your religion so that no one may have what you have received or may argue with you before your Lord Muhammad tell them The only guidance is the guidance of God
All favors are in the hands of God
He grants His favors to whomever He wants
He is Munificent and Allknowing
God grants priority in granting mercy to whomever He wants
God s favors are great
If you entrust some of the People of the Book with a large quantity of gold they will return it to you while if you entrust others among them with a small quantity of gold they will not give it back to you unless you keep insisting on its return
For they say We are not bound to keep our words with the illiterate people and they themselves knowingly ascribe false statements to God
Those who keep their promise and observe piety should know that God certainly loves the pious ones
Those who sell their covenant with God and their promises for a small price will have no share in the life hereafter
God will not speak to them nor will He look at them on the Day of Judgment nor will He purify them
They will face a painful torment
A group among the People of the Book when reading the Bible deliberately mispronounce words in order to change their meaning try to show that what they have read is from the true Bible
In fact what they have read is not from the true Bible
They say What we read is from God
In reality it is not from God
They knowingly ascribe false statements to God
God would never give the Book authority or prophesy to any person who would tell others to be his servants instead of being the servants of God
He would rather tell them to worship God for they had been teaching and studying the Book
A Prophet would never order you to take the angels and the Prophets as your Lords
Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted yourselves to God
When God made a covenant with the Prophets saying When I give you the Book and wisdom and a Messenger comes to you who will testify to the guidance which you have received from Me you must believe in him and help him then He asked them Do you affirm and accept my covenant
They replied Yes we affirm it
The Lord said Then bear witness to this and I shall bear witness with you
After this whoever turns away will be of the evildoers
Do they want a religion other than the religion of God when all that is in the heavens and the earth have submitted themselves to His will either by their own free will or by force To God do all things return
Muhammad say We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us and in that which was revealed to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and their descendants We believe in that which was given to Moses Jesus and the Prophets by their Lord
We make no distinction between them and we have submitted ourselves to the will of God
No religion other than Islam submission to the will of God will be accepted from anyone Whoever follows a religion other than Islam will be lost on the Day of Judgment
Why would God guide a people who disbelieves after having had faith who have found the Messenger to be truthful and who have received authoritative evidence
God does not guide the unjust
What they will gain will be the condemnation of God the angels and all people
with which they will live forever
Their torment will not be relieved and no attention will be paid to them
However to those who repent afterwards and reform themselves God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who disbelieve after having been believers and increase their disbelief are lost and their repentance will not be accepted
From those who have rejected the truth and died in disbelief no ransom will be accepted even though they may pay a whole earth of gold
They will suffer a painful torment and no one will help them
You can never have extended virtue and righteousness unless you spend part of what you dearly love for the cause of God
God knows very well whatever you spend for His cause
All food was lawful for the children of Israel except for what Israel had deemed unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed
Muhammad ask them to bring the Torah and read it if they are true in their claim that all food was not unlawful for the children of Israel
Whoever ascribes falsehood to God despite of all the evidence is unjust
Muhammad say God has spoken the Truth
Follow the upright tradition of Abraham who was not an idolater
The first house of worship that God assigned to men was in Bakka another name of Mecca It is a blessed one and a guide for all people
In Bakka there are many clear signs evidence of the existence of God
Among them is the spot where Abraham stood
Whoever seeks refuge therein will be protected by the laws of amnesty Those who have the means and ability have a duty to God to visit the House and perform the hajj pilgrimage rituals
The unbelievers should know that God is Independent of all creatures
Muhammad ask the People of the Book Why do you deny the revelations of God when He is WellAware of your dealings
Ask them Why do you create obstacles in the way of God for those who believe in Him trying to make His way seem crooked when you know that it is straight
God is not unaware of what you do
Believers if you obey a certain group among the People of the Book they will turn you back to disbelief
How could you turn back to disbelief when the words of God are recited to you and you have in your midst His Messenger
Those who seek the protection of God will certainly be guided to the right path
Believers have fear of God as you should and die only as Muslims having submitted to the will of God
All of you united hold fast to the rope of God the Quran and His Messenger and recall how He favored you when your hostility to each other had torn you apart
He united your hearts in one faith and through His Grace you became brothers
You were on the verge of falling headlong into the abyss of fire but God saved you
This is how God explains to you His revelations so that you may have the right guidance
Let there be a group among you who will invite others to do good deeds command them to obey the Law and prohibit them from committing sins
These people will have eternal happiness
Do not be like those who turned into quarrelling sects after receiving clear authoritative evidence
They will suffer a great torment
On the day when some faces will become white and others black God will ask the people with the faces which have become black Why did you give up your faith
Now suffer the torment for your disbelief
The people whose faces have become white will enjoy the mercy of God with which they will live forever
Such are God s revelations which We explain to you Muhammad for a genuine purpose
God does not want injustice for any of His creatures
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and to Him do all things return
You are the best nation that ever existed among humanity You command people to good and prohibit them from evil and you believe in God
Had the People of the Book accepted the faith Islam it would certainly have been better for them
Some of them have faith but most of them are evil doers
They can never harm you beyond annoyance
In a fight they will turn back in defeat and they will not be helped
Humiliation will strike them wherever they seek protection except when they seek protection from God and the people
They have incurred the wrath of God unto themselves and have been struck with destitution for their rejection of the revelations of God and for unjustly murdering the Prophets
It is all because of their transgression and rebellion
The People of the Book are not all the same
Some of them are straightforward They recite the words of God in prostration at night
They believe in God and the Day of Judgment They command people to follow good prohibit others from committing evil and compete with each other in doing good deeds
These are the righteous ones
They will never be denied the rewards of their good deeds
God knows well about the pious
The wealth and the children of the unbelievers can never make them independent of God
They are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever
What they spend in this life is like the freezing wind that may strike and destroy the farms of the people who have wronged themselves
God has not done injustice to them but they have wronged themselves
Believers do not expose your privacy to the unbelievers
They like to mislead you and see that you are seriously harmed
Signs of animosity from their mouths have already become audible but what they hide in their heads is even worse
We have certainly made Our evidence clear if only you would consider it
There are people whom you love but they do not love you despite your belief in all the heavenly Books
On meeting you They proclaim belief on meeting you but in private bite their fingers at you in anger
Tell them Perish in your rage
God knows well what is in everyone s hearts
They hate to see your success and rejoice if any misfortune befalls you
If you will be patient and pious their plots can cause no harm to you
God has control over all their actions
Muhammad remember the morning when you left home to show the believers their position in the battle
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Two groups among you almost lost courage despite having God as their Guardian
The believers should always have trust in God
God gave you victory in the battle of Badr where your forces were much weaker than those of the enemy
Have fear of God so that you may give Him thanks
Also remember when you said to the believers Is it not enough that your Lord is helping you with a force of three thousand angels sent from the heavens
Certainly if you have patience and piety even if the enemy attacks immediately after this God will help you with another force of five thousand angels all splendidly and or distinctly marked dressed
The sending of the angels is a glad news from your Lord so that you would have more confidence in Him
No victory is real unless it is from God the Majestic and Allwise
They are sent to break the power of the unbelievers or disgrace them and make them return after having lost all hope
Muhammad it is not your concern whether He forgives them or punishes them for they are unjust
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He may forgive or punish whomever He wants
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers do not accept illegal interest in order to increase your wealth many times over
Have fear of God so that you will have everlasting happiness
Save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for the unbelievers
Obey God and the Messenger so that you may receive mercy
Hasten to obtain forgiveness from your Lord and to qualify yourselves for Paradise Paradise vast as the heavens and the earth is prepared for the pious
who spend their property for the cause of God in prosperity as well as in adversity and who also harness their anger and forgive the people
God loves the righteous ones
Paradise is also for those who when committing a sin or doing injustice to themselves remember God and ask Him to forgive their sins
Who can forgive sins besides God
And who do not knowingly persist in their mistakes
Their reward will be forgiveness from their Lord and gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
How blessed is the reward of those who labor
Different traditions existed in the past
Travel in the land and find out about the fate of those who rejected the Truth
This Quran is a reminder for the people and a guide and advice for the pious
Do not be discouraged or grieved
You alone will have true dignity if you only are true believers
If you get hurt certainly others have also experienced injuries
We have made people pass through the different turns of history so that God would know the true believers have some of you bear witness to the people s deeds God does not love the unjust
test the faith of the believers and deprive the unbelievers of His blessings
Did you think that you could go to Paradise before God knew which of you fought for His cause and which of you bore patience
You certainly wished to die for the cause of God before you actually faced death
Then you faced death in the battlefield and only a few of you had the true desire to die
Muhammad is only a Messenger
There lived other Messengers before him
Should Muhammad die or be slain would you then turn back to your preIslamic behavior
Whoever does so can cause no harm to God
God will reward those who give thanks
No one can die without the permission of God
This is a written decree of the appointed term for life
We shall give worldly gains to whoever wants them Those who want rewards in the life hereafter will also receive them
We reward those who give thanks
Many godly people fought to help the Prophets in the cause of God
They did not lose courage show weakness or give in when facing hardships in their fight for the cause of God
God loves those who have patience
The only words that they spoke were Lord forgive our sins and our excess in our dealings make us steadfast in the fight for Your cause and grant us victory over the unbelievers
God gave them their reward in this world and the best reward of the life to come
God loves the righteous ones
Believers if you obey the unbelievers they will turn you back to disbelief and you will become lost
God is your Guardian and the best Helper
We shall cause terror to enter the hearts of the faithless for their considering things equal to God without authoritative evidence
Their abode will be fire a terrible dwelling for the unjust
God certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were fighting the unbelievers by His permission
Even after We showed you what you wanted you began to lose courage started quarreling with each other and disobeyed God s orders Some of you want worldly gains and others of you want rewards in the hereafter
Then He let you face defeat in order to test you
However He forgave you
God is Gracious to the believers
Believers remember when you were fleeing without even glancing to either side even though the Messengers were calling you back God made you suffer sorrow upon sorrow to make you forget your grief of what you had lost and the injuries you had suffered
God is WellAware of what you do
After the sorrows you suffered He sent you relief and some of you were encompassed by slumber
To some others of you your lives were so important that you like ignorant people began thinking suspiciously of God saying Do we have any say in the matter
Muhammad tell them All matters belong to God
They try to hide within their souls what they do not reveal to you They say Had we had the matter in our hands we would not have been killed there
Tell them Even if you had stayed in your own homes your sworn enemies could have attacked you and slain you while you were in your beds God wanted to test you and purge what existed in your hearts
God knows what the hearts contain Because of some of your bad deeds those of you who ran away when you faced the enemy were misled by Satan
God forgave you for He is Allforgiving and Forbearing
Believers do not be like the unbelievers who said of their brothers who travelled in the land or took part in a fight Had they stayed with us they would not have died or been killed
God will only cause regret to enter their hearts
It is God who gives life and causes people to die
God is Well Aware of what you do
If you were to die or to be killed for the cause of God certainly His forgiveness and mercy is far better than your worldly gains
If you die or are slain certainly you will all be brought before God
Only through the Divine Mercy have you Muhammad been able to deal with your followers so gently
If you had been stern and hardhearted they would all have deserted you a long time ago
Forgive them and ask God to forgive their sins and consult with them in certain matters But when you reach a decision trust God
God loves those who trust Him
If God is your helper no one can defeat you
However if He abandons you who would help you
The true believers trust in God
No Prophet can ever be treacherous
A treacherous person will be brought before God on the Day of Judgment with his treacherous deeds
Then every soul will be recompensed for its works without being wronged
Are those who seek God s pleasure equal to those who incur His wrath and whose dwelling will be hell the terrible destination
People are of various grades in the sight of God
God is WellAware of all that they do
God granted a great favor to the believers by sending a Messenger from their own people to recite to them God s revelations to purify them of moral defects to teach them the Book and to give them wisdom
Before this they had lived in manifest error
If misfortune befell you the believers your enemies had suffered twice as much in the battle of Badr but you asked Where did the misfortune come from
Muhammad tell them It came from yourselves
God has power over all things
What befell you when the two armies confronted each other was by the permission of God so that He would know who were the true believers
and who were the hypocrites
When the hypocrites were asked to fight for the cause of God or to defend the city they replied Had we known before that you would fight we would certainly not have followed you
At that time they were closer to disbelief than to faith
They speak words that do not come from their hearts
God knows well whatever they try to hide
There are those who themselves did not join the others in fighting for the cause of God and said about their brothers Had they listened to us and stayed at home they would not have been killed Muhammad tell them to save themselves from death if they are true in their claim
Do not think of those slain for the cause of God as dead
They are alive with their Lord and receive sustenance from Him
They are pleased with the favor from their Lord and have received the glad news that those who follow them will have no fear nor will they be grieved
that they will be rewarded with bounties and favors from their Lord and that God will not neglect the reward of the true believers
The righteous and pious of those who have pledged obedience to God and the Messenger after injury had befallen them will receive a great reward
Such people when warned to fear those who are gathered against them are strengthened in their faith and say God is Allsufficient as our Guardian
They returned with the favors and the bounties of God untouched by evil and followed by the pleasure of God
God s favor is great
It is Satan who frightens his friends
Do not be afraid of them enemies but have fear of Me if you truly believe
Muhammad do not be grieved because of some people s haste to disbelieve
They can do no harm to God God has decided not to give them any share in the life hereafter
There will be a great torment for them
Those who have traded faith in exchange for disbelief can never do any harm to God
There will be a painful torment for them
The unbelievers must not think that Our respite is for their good
We only give them time to let them increase their sins
For them there will be a humiliating torment
God left the believers in their existing state for no other reason than to distinguish the evildoers from the virtuous ones
God does not inform you of the unseen
He chooses for such information anyone of His Messengers that He wants
Have faith in God and in His Messengers
If you have faith and are pious there will be a great reward for you
Those who are avaricious of the favors that God has given them should not think that this is good for them
Avarice is evil and whatever they are avaricious about will be tied to their necks on the Day of Judgment
To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
God is Well Aware of what you do
God certainly has heard the words of those who said God is poor and we are wealthy
We shall write down what they have said and their murder of the Prophets without reason and We shall tell them to suffer the burning torment
This is only the result of their deeds God is not unjust to His servants
Muhammad say to those who say God has commanded us not to believe any Messenger unless he offers a burnt offering Muhammad say Messengers came to you before me with certain miracles and with that which you had asked for burnt offering
Why then did you slay them if you were true in your claim
If they reject you they had certainly rejected the Messengers who lived before you and who showed them authoritative evidence smaller Books and the Book of enlightenment
Every soul is destined to experience the agony of death
You Muslims will receive the recompense for your deeds on the Day of Judgment
To be saved from the fire and admitted to Paradise is certainly a great triumph
The worldly life is no more than a deceitful possession
You believers will certainly be tested by the loss of your property and lives and you will hear a great many grieving words from the People of the Book and the pagans
If you will have patience and piety it will be a sign of firm determination and steadfastness in life
When God made a covenant with the People of the Book saying Tell the people about it Muhammad s prophesy without hiding any part therefrom they threw it behind their backs and sold it for a very small price
What a miserable bargain
Do not think that those who are happy with their possessions and positions and those who love to be praised for what they themselves have not done can ever be saved from torment
For them there will be a painful punishment
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has power over all things
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the night are evidence of the existence of God for people of reason
It is these who commemorate God while standing sitting or resting on their sides and who think about the creation of the heavens and the earth and say Lord you have not created all this without reason
Glory be to you
Lord save us from the torment of the fire
Those whom You submit to the fire are certainly disgraced There is no helper for the unjust
Lord we have heard the person calling to the faith and have accepted his call
Forgive our sins expiate our bad deeds and let us die with the righteous ones
Lord grant us the victory that You have promised your Messenger and do not disgrace us on the Day of Judgment You are the One who never ignores His promise
Their Lord answered their prayers saying I do not neglect anyone s labor whether the laborer be male or female
You are all related to one another
Those who migrated from Mecca those who were expelled from their homes those who were tortured for My cause and those who fought and were killed for My cause will find their sins expiated by Me and I will admit them into the gardens wherein streams flow
It will be their reward from God Who grants the best rewards
Muhammad do not be deceived by the changing activities of the unbelievers in different parts of the land
Their gains are only a means of enjoyment in this life
However their destination is hell the terrible dwelling
For those who have fear of their Lord there will be gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever as a gift from their Lord
God has the best reward for the virtuous people
There are some among the People of the Book who believe in God and what is revealed to you and to them They are humble before God and do not trade God s revelations for a small price
They will receive their reward from their Lord
God s reckoning is swift
Believers have patience help each other with patience establish good relations with one another and have fear of God so that you may have everlasting happiness
People have fear of your Lord who has created you from a single soul From it He created your spouse and through them He populated the land with many men and women
Have fear of the One by whose Name you swear to settle your differences and have respect for your relatives
God certainly keeps watch over you
Give to the orphans their property
Do not exchange the pure for the filthy and do not spend the property of orphans along with your own this would be a great sin
With respect to marrying widows if you are afraid of not being able to maintain justice with her children marry another woman of your choice or two or three or four who have no children If you cannot maintain equality with more than one wife marry only one or your slavegirl
This keeps you from acting against justice
Pay the women their dowry as though it were a gift
However if they allow you to keep a part of it as a favor to you you may spend it with pleasure
Do not give to people weak of understanding your property for which God has made you to supervise
Feed and clothe such people and speak to them in a reasonable way
Before returning orphan s property to them make sure that they have reached maturity
Do not consume their property wastefully until such a time
The rich guardian should not take any of his ward s property However a poor guardian may use a reasonable portion
When you return their property make sure you have witness
God is a perfect in taking accounts
Male and female are entitled to their legal share in the legacy of their parents and relatives whether it be small or large
If relatives orphans or destitute people are present at the distribution of the legacy give them something and speak kindly to them
Those who are concerned about the welfare of their own children after their death should have fear of God when dealing with the orphans and guide them properly
Those who wrongfully consume the property of orphans are in fact consuming fire in their bellies and they will suffer the blazing fire
This is a commandment from your Lord After the payment of debts or anything bequeathed let the male inherit twice as much as the female
If there are more than two girls they will have twothirds of the legacy
If there is only one girl she will inherit half of the legacy
Parents of the deceased will each inherit onesixth of the legacy if the deceased has a surviving child however if no children survive the deceased and the heirs are the parents the mother will receive onethird of the legacy
The mother will receive onesixth of the legacy if the deceased has more than one surviving brother
These are the decreed shares according to the laws of God
Regardless of how you feel about your parents or children you do not know which of them is more beneficial to you
God is Allknowing and Allwise
If your wives die without any surviving children you will inherit half of their legacy If they have children you will inherit onefourth of their legacy after the debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy
After the payment of debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy your wives will inherit onefourth of your legacy if you have no surviving children
If you leave a child they will inherit one eighth of your legacy
If the deceased either male or female has no surviving heirs such as parents or children but has a brother or a sister the brother or sister will each inherit onesixth of the legacy
If there are more than just a brother or a sister they will share onethird of the legacy
This is after the payment of any debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy so that no one will be caused to suffer any loss
It is a guide from God the Allknowing and Forbearing
These are the laws of God
Whoever obeys God and His Messenger will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever This is the greatest triumph
Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger and breaks His rules will be admitted to the fire wherein they will live forever suffering a humiliating torment
Those of your women who commit fornication let four Muslim witness testify to their act
If there is sufficient testimony confine them to their homes until they die or until God provides a way for their freedom
If any two people commit fornication punish them
If they repent and reform let them go
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God will only accept the repentance of those who commit evil in ignorance if they repent immediately
God is Allknowing and Allwise
There is no forgiveness for those who commit sin and do not repent until the last moment of their lives nor for those who die as unbelievers
For these people We have prepared a painful torment
Believers it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will as part of the legacy
Do not create difficulties for your wives in order to force them to giveup part of what you had given to them to set themselves free from the bond of marriage unless they have clearly committed adultery
Always treat them reasonably
If you dislike them you could be disliking that which God has filled with abundant good
If you want to divorce a woman so that you can marry another do not take back the dowry which you had paid even if what you paid was a large amount of gold
To do this is a slanderous act and a manifest sin
How can you take it back when you have had intimate relations and made a solemn agreement with each other
Do not marry from now on the exwives of your fathers for that custom was sinful loathsome and abominable
You are forbidden to marry your mothers daughters sisters paternal aunts maternal aunts nieces your fostermothers your fostersisters your mothersinlaw your stepdaughters whom you have brought up and with whose mothers you have had carnal relations
It would not be a sin to marry her if you did not have carnal relations with her mother
You are forbidden to marry the wives of your own sons and to marry two sisters at the same time without any adverse affect to the such relations of the past
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
You are forbidden to marry married women except your slavegirls This is the decree of God
Besides these it is lawful for you to marry other women if you pay their dower maintain chastity and do not commit indecency
If you marry them for the appointed time you must pay their dowries
There is no harm if you reach an understanding among yourselves about the dowry God is Allknowing and Allwise
If any of you do not have the means to marry a chaste believing woman marry your believing slavegirls
God knows best about your faith
You have the same faith
Marry them with the permission of their masters and if they are chaste and have avoided fornication and amorous activities give them their just dowries
If after marriage they commit adultery they should receive half of the punishment of a free woman who has committed the same crime
This is for those who fear falling into evil
It is better for you to have selfcontrol
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God wants to guide you explain to you the customs of those who lived before you and grant you forgiveness
He is Allknowing and Allwise
God wants to be merciful to you but those who follow their evil desires seek to lead you astray
God wants to relieve you of your burden all human beings were created weak
Believers do not exchange your property in wrongful ways unless it is in trade by mutual agreement Do not kill one another
God is Allmerciful to you
Whoever commits murder out of animosity and injustice will be burnt in hell fire
This is a very easy thing for God to do
If you avoid violating that which has been prohibited your lesser sins will be forgiven and you will be admitted into an exalted dwelling
Do not envy the favors which God has granted to some of you
Men and women will both be rewarded according to their deeds rather pray to God for His favors
God knows all things
We have chosen heirs for every legacy that parents and relatives may leave
Let those who have been promised a bequest receive their share of the legacy
God is Omnipresent
Men are the protectors of women because of the greater preference that God has given to some of them and because they financially support them
Among virtuous women are those who are steadfast in prayer and dependable in keeping the secrets that God has protected
Admonish women who disobey God s laws do not sleep with them and beat them
If they obey the laws of God do not try to find fault in them
God is High and Supreme
If there appears to be discord between a wife and her husband and if they desire reconciliation choose arbiters from the families of both sides
God will bring them together God is Allknowing and Allaware
Worship God and consider no one equal to Him
Be kind to your parents relatives orphans the destitute your near and distant neighbors your companions wayfarers and your slaves
God does not love the proud and boastful ones
the stingy ones who try to make others stingy or those who hide the favors that God has bestowed on them
We have prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers
those who spend their property out of a desire to show off and not because of their belief in God and the Day of Judgment and lastly those who choose Satan for a friend what an evil friend
How could it have harmed them if they had believed in God and the Last Day and spent their property for the cause of God
God knows them very well
God does not do even an atom s weight of injustice
A good deed is multiplied by God and richly rewarded
How will it be when We call for a witness from every nation and have you Muhammad testify against them all
At that time the disbelievers who disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they could be turned into dust and they will be able to hide nothing from God
Believers do not pray when you are drunk but instead wait until you can understand what you say Also do not pray when you have experienced a seminal discharge until after you have taken a bath unless you are on a journey
If while sick or on a journey you can find no water after having defecated or after having had carnal relations perform tayammum by touching your palms on the pure earth and wipe the upper part of your face and the backs of your hands
God is Gracious and Allforgiving
Have you seen those who had received a portion of the Book trade misguidance and try to make you too go astray
God knows who are your enemies
You need to have no guardian or helper other than God
Some Jews take certain words out of context and by twisting their tongues to make a jest out of the true religion say We heard and in our hearts disobeyed Muhammad ra ina be kind to us but they intend thereby the meaning in their own language Listen
May God turn you deaf They should have said We heard and obeyed
Muhammad listen and consider our question This would have been better for them and more righteous
God has condemned them for their disbelief thus no one except a few among them will have faith
People of the Book have faith in the Quran that We have revealed to confirm your Book before certain faces are changed and turned back We shall condemn them as We did the people of the Sabbath about whom God s decree had decisively been ordained
God does not forgive the sin of considering others equal to Him but He may choose to forgive other sins
Whoever believes in other gods besides Him has indulged in a great sin
Muhammad have you seen those who try to purify themselves
They should know that God only purifies whomever He wants and that the slightest wrong will not be done to such people
Consider how they create lies about God
This alone is a grave sin
Have you seen how those who had been given a share of the Book believe in idols and Satan and who say The disbelievers are better guided than the believers
God has condemned them
No one can help one who has been condemned by God
Even if they had a share in the Kingdom Divine authority they would not have given the smallest thing to anyone
Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to some people
We have given to the family of Abraham the Book Wisdom and a great Kingdom
Some have believed others have disbelieved and tried to prevent people from believing
For these people only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient punishment
We will make the rejectors of Our revelations suffer in hell fire
As soon as the fire destroys their skins We will give them new skins so that they may suffer more of the torment
God is Majestic and Allwise
We will admit the righteously striving believers into the gardens wherein streams flow
They will live therein forever in a cool shade with their pure spouses
God commands you to return that which had been entrusted to you to the rightful owners
Be just when passing judgment among people God s advice is the most noble
He sees and hears everything
Believers obey God His Messenger and your qualified leaders
If you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment refer to God and His Messenger concerning matters in which you differ
This would be a more virtuous and a better way of settling differences
Muhammad have you seen those who think that they have faith in what is revealed to you and to others before you yet choose to take their affairs to Satan for judgment even though they are commanded to deny him Satan wants to lead them far away from the right path
When the hypocrites are told to refer to God s revelations and to the Messenger they try to find excuses to stay away from you Muhammad
What would happen if they were to be afflicted by a disaster brought about by their own hands
They would then come to you swearing by God We only wanted to bring about friendship and reconciliation
God knows what is in their hearts
Muhammad ignore their faults advise them and tell them frankly about what is in their souls
We did not send any Messengers for any reason other than to be obeyed because of the will of God
If they ever do injustice to themselves and come to you Muhammad asking for God s forgiveness and if the Messenger also was to ask God to forgive them they would certainly find God Allforgiving and Allmerciful
I swear by your Lord that they will not be considered believers until they let you judge their disputes and then they will find nothing in their souls to prevent them from accepting your judgment thus submitting themselves to the will of God
Had We commanded them to kill themselves or abandon their homes only a few of them would have done it
If they had done what they had been advised to do it would have strengthened their faith
We would have given them a great reward
and guided them to the right path
One who obeys God and the Messenger is the friend of the Prophets saints martyrs and the righteous ones to whom God has granted His favors
They are the best friends that one can have
The favors of God are such and He knows very well how to reward you
Believers always be well prepared and on your guard March in small groups or all together
There are some among you who lag behind in battle and if you were to experience hardship they would say It was certainly due to God s favors to us that we were not present with them
but if you were to receive a favor from God they would certainly say We have been ignored as if there was no friendship among us Would that we had been there with them for we would have had a great success
Those who want to buy the life hereafter with this life should fight for the cause of God
We will give them a great reward whether they are killed or whether they are victorious
Why do you not fight for the cause of God or save the helpless men women and children who cry out Lord set us free from this town of wrong doers and send us a guardian and a helper
The believers fight for the cause of God
The unbelievers fight for the cause of the Satan
So fight against the friends of Satan for the evil plans of Satan are certainly weak
Have you not seen those who were told to stop fighting to say their prayers and pay the religious tax
When they were ordered to fight some of them feared other men as much as or more than they feared God and so they said Lord why have you ordered us to fight If only you would give us a little time
Muhammad tell them The pleasures of the worldly life are trivial
The life hereafter is best for the pious ones
You will not be treated the slightest bit unjustly
Wherever you are death will find you even if you hide yourselves in firmly constructed towers
Whenever people experience good fortune they say that it is from God but whenever they experience misfortune they say it is because of you Muhammad
Tell them Everything is from God
What is wrong with these people that they do not even try to understand
Whatever good you may receive is certainly from God and whatever you suffer is from yourselves
We have sent you Muhammad as a Messenger to people
God is a Sufficient witness to your truthfulness
One who obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed God
You have not been sent to watch over those who turn away from you
They proclaim obedience to you but as soon as they leave at night a group of them make secret plans to do the contrary of what you have told them to do
God keeps the record of their nocturnal plans
Therefore leave them alone and put your trust in God He is Sufficient for you as your Guardian
Will they not ponder on the Quran
Had it not come from someone other than God they would have certainly found therein many contradictions
When they receive any news of peace or war they announce it in public
Had they told it to the Messenger or to their qualified leaders they could have used that information more properly
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God all but a few of them would have followed Satan
Thus Muhammad fight for the cause of God
You are only responsible for yourself
Rouse the believers and perhaps God will stop the evil designs of the unbelievers
God s punishment and retribution is the most severe
Whoever intercedes for a good purpose will receive his share of the reward but the intercession for an evil purpose only adds more to one s burden
God has control over all things
Answer a greeting in kinder words than those said to you in the greeting or at least as kind
God keeps account of all things
God exists He is the only Lord
He will gather you all together on the Day of Judgment which will certainly come
Who is more truthful than God
Why are you divided into two different parties concerning the hypocrites when God Himself has turned them to disbelief because of their misdeeds
Do you want to guide those whom God has caused to go astray
You cannot find guidance for those whom God has made to err
They wish you to become unbelievers as they themselves are
Do not establish friendship with them until they have abandoned their homes for the cause of God
If they betray you seize them and slay them wherever you find them
Do not establish friendship with them or seek their help
except with those who attach themselves to your allies or come to you with no desire to fight you or their own people
God could have given them power to fight you
Thus if they retreat stop fighting and come forward expressing faith in Islam God will not allow you to fight them
You will soon find others who seek security from you as well as from their own people but when they are invited to return to idol worship they do so enthusiastically Thus if they do not keep away from you nor come forward with a peace proposal nor desist from harming you apprehend and slay them wherever you find them for We have given you full control over them
A believer cannot slay another believer except by mistake for which the retaliation is to set free a believing slave and pay the appointed blood money to the relatives of the deceased unless the relatives wave aside the payment
If the person slain is from your enemies but himself is a believer the penalty is to set free a believing slave
If the person slain is one of those with whom you have a peace treaty the penalty is the same as that for a slain believer
If this is not possible the defendant has to fast for two consecutive months asking God to accept his repentance
He is Allknowing and Allwise
The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hell fire forever
God is angry with him and has condemned him He has prepared for him a great torment
Believers if you march with arms for the cause of God make sure that you know whom to fight
Do not accuse anyone who claims himself to be a Muslim of disbelief just for worldly gains
There is abundant bounty with God
Before you were also like them but God bestowed His favors upon you
Thus make sure that you know whom to fight
God is Well Aware of what you do
Among the believers those who stay at home without a good reason are not equal to those who strive for the cause of God in person or with their property
To those who strive for His cause in person or with their property God has granted a higher rank than to those who stay at home
God has promised that everyone will receive his proper share of the reward but He will grant a much greater reward to those striving for His cause than to those who stay home for no reason
God will grant those who strive high ranks forgiveness and mercy
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When the angels take away from their bodies the souls of those who have wronged themselves they will ask them How did you live
They will reply We lived on earth in weakness and oppression
The angels will say Was not God s land vast enough for you to go wherever you could live in peace
The dwelling of these people will be hell fire a terrible destination
As for the really weak and oppressed men women and children who were not able to find any means of obtaining their freedom or of having the right guidance
perhaps God will forgive them He is Allmerciful and Allforgiving
One who abandons his home for the cause of God will find many places of refuge in the vast land and one who dies after having abandoned his home to get near to God and His Messenger will receive his reward from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When you are on a journey it is no sin to shorten your prayers if you are afraid of the mischief of the unbelievers
The unbelievers have always been your sworn enemies
Muhammad if you are among them your followers during a battle and you call them for prayer let a group of them carry their arms during prayer
After they have made their prostrations let them go back to watch the enemy and let the other group who has not yet prayed join you carrying their arms with due precaution
The unbelievers would love to find you neglecting your arms and property and would attack you suddenly
If rain or illness make you suffer you may place your arms aside during prayer but still observe due precaution
God has prepared a humiliating torment for the unbelievers
When you complete your prayer remember God all the time while standing sitting or reclining When you are safe say your prayers properly
It is a constant duty of the believers
Do not neglect the pursuit of the enemy
If you have suffered they too have suffered but you can at least expect from God what they can never expect
God is Allknowing and Allwise
We have revealed to you the Book in all Truth so that you judge among people by the laws of God
However never defend the treacherous ones
Seek forgiveness from God
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not defend those who deceive themselves God does not love those who are treacherous and sinful
They hide their sins from other people but they cannot hide themselves from God who is constantly with them even when they hold nocturnal meetings a thing which God does not like
God comprehends all that they do
You defend them in this life but who will defend them against God on the Day of Judgment and who will be their attorney
One who commits a sin or does wrong to himself and then seeks forgiveness from God will find God Allforgiving and Allmerciful
One who commits sins has committed them against his own soul
God is Allknowing and Allwise
One who makes a mistake or commits a sin and ascribes it to an innocent person he only burdens himself with slander and a grave sin
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God some of them would have certainly tried to make you Muhammad go astray
However they cannot lead any one astray but themselves nor can they harm you
God has revealed the Book to you has given you wisdom and has taught you what you did not know
Certainly God s favor to you has been great
There is nothing good in much of their secret talks except for that which is for charity justice or for reconciliation among people to seek thereby the pleasure of God for which We will give a great reward
Whoever gives the Messenger a hard time even after having received clear guidance and follows a path other than that of the believers will be left alone
We will cast him into hell a terrible destination
God will not forgive the sin of considering something equal to Him but He may forgive the other sins of whomever He wants
One who considers anything equal to God has certainly gone far away from the right path
They the pagans only worship idols and Satan the persistent rebel
God condemned Satan when he said I will certainly take my revenge from Your servants
I will lead them astray induce in their hearts prolonged worldly desires command them to pierce the ears of their animals sacrificed for the idols and order them to change the religion of God
One who accepts Satan as his guardian instead of God has certainly incurred a great loss upon himself
Satan gives them false promises and tempts them to develop longings which can never be realized
Such people will dwell in hell fire from which they will not be able to escape
We will admit the righteously striving believers to Paradise wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever
God s promise is true for no one is more truthful than Him
Believers and People of the Book wishes alone can never provide you with salvation
Whoever commits evil will be punished accordingly and no one besides God will be his guardian or helper
Any believer male or female who acts righteously will enter Paradise and will not suffer the least bit of injustice
Whose religion is better than that in which one submits himself to God behaves righteously and follows the upright religion of Abraham God s chosen friend
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has control over all things
Muhammad they ask you concerning women
Tell them God will instruct you about them besides that which can be read in the Book about widows with children whom you wanted to marry without giving them their due rights and He will instruct you about the rights of the weak and oppressed children God commands you to maintain justice with the orphans
God knows all about whatever good you do
If a woman is afraid of her husband s ill treatment and desertion it will be no sin for both of them to reach a reconciliation
Reconciliation is good even though men s souls are swayed by greed
If you act righteously and be pious God is Well Aware of what you do
You will never be able to maintain justice among your wives and love them all equally no matter how hard you try
Do not give total preference to one of them leaving the other as if in suspense
If you do bring about reconciliation and maintain piety God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If the marriage is terminated God will make each one of them financially independent
God is Munificent and Wise
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
We have told you and the People of the Book to have fear of God
If you all refuse to believe in Him know that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is a totally Sufficient Guardian
Had God wanted He could have destroyed you all and replaced you by another people He has the power to do so
Be it known to those who want worldly rewards that God holds the rewards for this life as well as the life to come
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Believers be the supporters of justice and the testify to what you may have witnessed for the sake of God even against yourselves parents and relatives whether it be against the rich or the poor
God must be given preference over them
Let not your desires cause you to commit injustice
If you deviate from the truth in your testimony or decline to give your testimony at all know that God is Well Aware of what you do
Believers have faith in God and His Messenger the Book which is revealed to him and the Bible which has been revealed before
Whoever refuses to believe in God His angels Books Messengers and the Day of Judgment has gone far away from the right path
God will not forgive or guide to the right path those who first believe then disbelieve again believe and disbelieve and then increase their disbelief
Tell the hypocrites that for them there will be a painful torment
Do those who establish friendship with the disbelievers instead of the believers seek honor
Let them know that all honor belongs to God
God has told you believers in the Book that when you hear people disbelieving and mocking God s revelations do not sit with them unless they change the subject
You will become like them
God will gather all the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in hell fire
The hypocrites wait and watch
If God grants you victory they say Did we not help you If the unbelievers are victorious they say Did we not encourage you not to surrender to the believers and did we not protect you from them
God will judge among you on the Day of Judgment
He will never help the disbelievers against the believers
The hypocrites try to deceive God but He in fact deceives them
They stand up in prayer lazily just to show that they pray but in truth they remember God very little
They are hesitant people belonging to neither side
You can find no other way for one whom God has caused to go astray
Believers do not make unbelievers your intimate friends and supporters rather than believers
Do you want to establish clear evidence against yourselves before God
The hypocrites will be placed in the lowest bottom of the fire and none of you will ever find a helper for them except
those hypocrites who have repented put their trust in God and sincerely followed only His religion will live with the believers to whom God will give a great reward
Why should God punish you if you give thanks and believe in Him God is Allrewarding and Allforgiving
God does not love public accusation unless one is truly wronged
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Whether you act virtuously in public or in private or pardon people s faults God is Allforgiving and Allpowerful
Those who disbelieve in God and His Messengers try to create differences between God and His Messengers by rejecting their message
They say We believe in some but not in others Thus they try to find a middle way
but in fact they are unbelievers and for them We have prepared a humiliating torment
As for those who believe in God and make no distinction between His Messengers they will receive His reward
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad the People of the Book ask you to make a Book descend to them from the heavens
However they had asked Moses for things much harder to do than this by saying Show us God in person
Thunder and lightning struck them because of their unjust demands
Despite all the evidence that had come to them they started to worship the calf but We forgave them for their sins and gave Moses clear authority
We raised Mount Sinai above them because of Our solemn promise to them Also We told them to prostrate themselves when entering the gate of the holy house and not to commit transgression on the Sabbath
We made a solemn covenant with them
However because of their disbelief disregard of their covenant denial of God s revelations murdering the Prophets without reason and their saying that their hearts were covered We sealed up their hearts
Only a few of them believe
Their hearts were also sealed because of their lack of faith their gravely slanderous accusation against Mary
and their statement that they murdered Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God when in fact they could not have murdered him or crucified him
They in fact murdered someone else by mistake
Even those who disputed the question of whether or not Jesus was murdered did not have a shred of evidence
All that they knew about it was mere conjecture
They certainly could not have murdered Jesus
God raised him up to Himself
God is Majestic and Allwise
There will be no one among the People of the Book who will not believe a belief of no value in him Jesus before their deaths On the Day of Judgment Jesus will testify against them
We made unlawful for the Jews certain pure things which had been lawful for them before because of the injustice which they had committed their obstructing many people from the way of God
their taking usury which was prohibited for them and their consuming people s property unjustly
For the unbelievers among them We have prepared a painful torment
However the learned among them the Jews and the faithful believe in what God has revealed to you Muhammad and to the others before you and those who are steadfast in prayer pay their religious tax and believe in God and the Day of Judgment
They all will receive a great reward from Us
Muhammad We have sent revelations to you just as were sent to Noah and the Prophets who lived after him and to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob his descendants Jesus Job Jonah Aaron and Solomon
We gave the Psalms to David
We sent revelations to the Messengers mentioned to you before and also to Messengers who have not been mentioned to you
God spoke to Moses in words
The Messengers were sent to give people the glad news of God s mercy and warn them of His punishment so that the human being would not have any objections against God after the coming of the Messengers that they did not have any knowledge of His mercy and punishment
God is Majestic and Allwise
God testifies that whatever He has revealed to you Muhammad He has revealed it on purpose and the angels also testify to it but God s testimony alone is Sufficient
Those who have rejected the faith and have obstructed people from the way of God have certainly gone far away from the right path
God will not forgive those who have rejected the faith and committed injustice nor will He guide them to any way
other than that of hell wherein they will live forever
For God this is not in the least bit difficult
Mankind the Messenger has come to you from your Lord in all Truth It is for your own good to believe in him but if you disbelieve know that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth God is Allknowing and Allwise
People of the Book do not exceed the limits of devotion in your religion or say anything about God which is not the Truth
Jesus son of Mary is only a Messenger of God His Word and a spirit from Him whom He conveyed to Mary
So have faith in God and His Messengers
Do not say that there are three gods
It is better for you to stop believing in the Trinity
There is only One God
He is too glorious to give birth to a son
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God alone is a Sufficient Guardian for all
Jesus never disdained the worship of God nor did the nearest angels to God
Whoever out of pride disdains the worship of God should know that everyone will be brought before Him
The righteously striving believers will receive the reward for their deeds and extra favors from God
But those who disdain the worship of God out of pride will suffer the most painful torment
They will find no guardian or helper besides God
Mankind an undeniable proof has certainly come to you and We have sent you a shining light
Those who believe in God and seek His protection will receive His mercy favors and His guidance to the right path
Muhammad they seek your verdict
Tell them God commands this concerning your kindred If a man dies childless but has a sister she will receive half of the legacy
If a woman dies childless her brother will receive the whole legacy
If a childless man leaves only two sisters both will receive twothirds of the legacy
If the heirs are both sisters and brothers the share of a male will be twice as much as the share of the female
God explains His Laws to you so that you will not go astray
God knows all things
Believers stand by your contracts and obligations
Of all animals cattle has been made lawful for you as food with certain exceptions Hunting is not lawful for you during ihram a part of the rituals during pilgrimage
God decrees as He wills
Believers do not disrespect the reminders of God the sacred months the animals brought for sacrifice or what is marked for sacrificial offering or the people heading to the precinct of the Sacred House to seek the favor and pleasure of their Lord
Once the restrictions of ihram are over you may hunt
Do not let the hostility of a group of people keep you away from the Sacred Mosque or make you express animosity
Cooperate with each other in righteousness and piety not in sin and hostility
Have fear of God He is stern in His retribution
It is unlawful for you to consume the following as food an animal that has not been properly slaughtered blood pork an animal slaughtered and consecrated in the name of someone other than God an animal killed by strangulation or a violent blow an animal killed by falling down an animal which has been gored to death an animal partly eaten by a wild beast before being properly slaughtered an animal which has been sacrificed on the stone blocks which pagans worshipped and any flesh divided by casting superstitious and gambling arrows a pagan tradition which is a sin
Today the unbelievers have lost hope about your religion
Do not be afraid of them but have fear of Me
On this day I have perfected your religion completed My favors to you and have chosen Islam as your religion
If anyone not normally inclined to sin is forced by hunger to eat unlawful substances instead of proper food he may do so to spare his life
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad they ask you what has been made lawful for them as food
Tell them All pure things are made lawful for you
If you train dogs or other beasts for hunting you should train them according to what God has taught you
It then is lawful for you to eat the animals that they hunt provided you mention the Name of God over the prey
Have fear of God
Certainly God s reckoning is swift
On this day all pure things are made lawful for you as food
The food of the People of the Book is made lawful for you and your food is made lawful for them
It is lawful for you to marry chaste Muslim women and chaste women of the People of the Book provided you pay their dowry maintain chastity and avoid fornication or lustful relations outside of marriage The deeds of anyone who rejects the faith certainly become fruitless
He will be of those who lose on the Day of Judgment
Believers when you are about to pray wash your face and your hands along with the elbows and wipe your head and your feet to the ankles
If you experience a seminal discharge manage to take the required bath
If you are sick or on a journey or have just defecated or have had intercourse with women and cannot find any water perform a tayammum by touching clean natural earth with both palms and wiping the upper part of your face and the back of your hands God does not want you to suffer hardship
He wants you to be purified He wants to complete His favors to you so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Remember God s favors to you and the firm covenant that He has made with you You said because of this covenant We have heard the words of the Lord and have obeyed Him
Have fear of God He knows well all that the hearts contain
Believers be steadfast for the cause of God and just in bearing witness
Let not a group s hostility to you cause you to deviate from justice
Be just for it is closer to piety
Have fear of God God is Well Aware of what you do
God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to the righteously striving believers
However the unbelievers who have called Our revelations lies will have hell for their dwelling
Believers recall God s favors to you when a group of people were about to harm you and God made their evil plots against you fail
Have fear of God
Believers only trust in God
God certainly made a solemn covenant with the children of Israel and raised among them twelve elders
God said to them I am with you if you will be steadfast in your prayers pay zakat religious tax believe in My Messengers support them with reverence and give a generous loan for the cause of God We shall expiate your bad deeds and admit you to the gardens wherein streams flow
Whichever of you turns to disbelief after this has certainly gone astray from the right path
For their disregard of their solemn covenant with God We condemned the Israelites and made their hearts hard as stone Now they displace the words of God and have forgotten their share of the guidance that they had received
Still you receive news of the treachery of all but a few of them
Forgive and ignore them
God loves the righteous ones
We had made a solemn covenant with those who call themselves Christians but they forgot their share of the guidance that was sent to them
We have induced hatred and animosity among them which will remain with them until the Day of Judgment when God will tell them about what they had done
People of the Book Our Messenger has come to you He tells you about the many things that you had been hiding of the Book and forgives you much
A light and a clarifying Book has come to you from God
to show the way of peace to those who seek His pleasure to bring them out of darkness into light through His will and to guide them to the right path
Those who have said that the Messiah son of Mary is God have in fact committed themselves to disbelief
Muhammad ask them Who can prevent God from destroying the Messiah his mother and all that is in the earth
To God belongs all that is in the heavens the earth and all that is between them
God creates whatever He wants and He has power over all things
The Jews and Christians call themselves the beloved sons of God
Muhammad ask them Why does God punish you for your sins
In fact you are mere human beings whom He has created
He forgives and punishes whomever He wants
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens the earth and all that is between them and to Him do all things return
People of the Book Our Messenger has come to you to guide you at a time when none of Our other Messengers are living among you We sent him so that you will not complain about having no one to tell you of what is good or warn you of what is bad
Now a bearer of good news has come to you
God has power over all things
When Moses told his people Recall God s favors to you He made Messengers and Kings out of your own people and gave you what He had not given to others
Enter the sacred promised land which God has designated for you Do not return to disbelief lest you become lost
They said Moses a giant race of people is living there
We shall never go there unless they leave the land first
If they leave it then we will enter
Two Godfearing men on whom God had bestowed favors told them Proceed through the gates and when you enter the city you will be victorious
Have trust in God if you are true believers
They said Moses as long as they are in the land we shall never go there
Go with your Lord to fight them but we shall stay where we are
Moses said Lord I can only speak for myself and my brother keep us away from the evildoers
The Lord said The land will be prohibited to them for forty years during all such time they will wander in the land
Do not feel sad for the evildoing people
Muhammad tell them the true story of the two sons of Adam Abel and Cain
Each one of them offered a sacrifice God accepted the sacrifice of one of them Abel but not that of the other Cain who then said to his brother I shall certainly kill you
Abel replied God only accepts the offerings of the pious ones
Even if you try to kill me I certainly shall not try to kill you
I have fear of God the Lord of the creation
I would prefer you to take sole responsibility for both our sins and thus become a dweller of hell this is what an unjust person deserves
Cain s soul prompted him to kill his own brother In doing so he became of those who lose
God sent down a raven which started to dig up the earth to show the killer how to bury the corpse of his brother
On seeing the raven Cain said Woe to me
Am I less able than a raven to bury the corpse of my brother
He became greatly remorseful
For this reason We made it a law for the children of Israel that the killing of a person for reasons other than legal retaliation or for stopping corruption in the land is as great a sin as murdering all of mankind
However to save a life would be as great a virtue as to save all of mankind
Our Messengers had come to them with clear authoritative evidence but many of them Israelites thereafter started doing wrong in the land
The only proper recompense for those who fight against God and His Messenger and try to spread evil in the land is to be killed crucified or either to have one of their hands and feet cut from the opposite side or to be sent into exile
These are to disgrace them in this life and they will suffer a great torment in the life hereafter
As for those who repent before you the legal authorities have control over them by proving their guilts
They should know that God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers have fear of God
Find the means to reach Him and strive hard for His cause so that you may have everlasting happiness
Had the unbelievers had twice as much as the wealth of the whole earth in order to ransom themselves from the torment in the life hereafter still their ransom would not have been accepted
For them there will be a painful torment
They will wish to get out of the fire but they will not have such a choice
Their torment will be constant
Cut off the hands of a male or female thief as a punishment for their deed and a lesson for them from God
God is Majestic and Allwise
However God will accept the repentance of whoever repents and reforms himself after committing injustice He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do you not know that to God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that He punishes or forgives whomever He wants
God has power over all things
Messenger do not be grieved about the people who run back to disbelief They only say that they believe but in fact they have no faith in their hearts
Some Jews knowingly listen to lies and accept the lies which come from others Jews who have no relation with you and who distort certain words of the Bible and say to the people Accept only those words which are the same as what We have told you
If you do not then beware You can not help those whom God wants to try
God does not want to cleanse the hearts of such people
They lead a disgraceful life in this world and in the life hereafter they will suffer a great torment
They deliberately listen to lies for deceitful purposes and live on usury
If they come to you seeking your judgment to settle their differences you may settle their disputes or keep aloof from them
Should you choose not to bother with them it will not harm you in the least
If you decide to issue your decree decide their case with justice
God loves those who are just
How can they come to you for judgment when they already have the Torah which contains the decree of God It does not take them long to disregard your judgment they are not true believers
We had revealed the Torah containing guidance and light
The Prophets who had submitted themselves to the will of God judged the Jews by the laws of the Torah
So did the godly people and the Jewish scholars who remembered some parts of the Book of God and bore witness to it
Mankind do not be afraid of people but have fear of Me
Do not sell My revelations for a paltry price
Those who do not judge by the laws of God are disbelievers
In the Torah We made mandatory for the Jews these rules of retaliation Capital punishment for the murder of a person an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and a just compensation for a wound
If the perpetrator is forgiven by the affected party this will be an expiation of his crime
Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are unjust
We made Jesus son of Mary follow in the footsteps of the earlier Prophets and confirm what existed in the Torah in his time
We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light as a confirmation of the Torah and instruction and advice for the pious ones
The followers of the Gospels the New Testament must judge according to what God has revealed in it
Those who do not judge by the laws of God are evil doers
We have revealed the Book to you Muhammad in all Truth It confirms the original Bible and has the authority to preserve or abrogate what the Bible contains
Judge among them by what God has revealed to you and do not follow their desires instead of the Truth which has come to you
We have given a law and a way of life to each of you
Had God wanted He could have made you into one nation but He wanted to see who are the more pious ones among you
Compete with each other in righteousness
All of you will return to God who will tell you the truth in the matter of your differences
Muhammad you must judge among them by what God has revealed
Do not follow their desires
Beware of their mischievous deception concerning some of the matters that God has revealed to you
If they turn away know that what God wants is to punish them for some of their sins
Many human beings are evildoers
Do they want judgments that are issued out of ignorance
Who is a better judge for the people whose belief is based on certainty than God
Believers do not consider the Jews and Christians as your intimate friends for they are only friends with each other
Whoever does so will be considered as one of them
God does not guide the unjust people
Muhammad you have seen those whose hearts are sick running around among the people Jews saying We are afraid of being struck by disaster
But if God were to grant you victory or some other favors they would then regret for what they had been hiding in their souls
The believers say Are these the people who proclaimed themselves to be our sworn friends
Their deeds have become devoid of all virtue and they themselves have become lost
Believers whichever of you turns away from his faith should know that God will soon raise a people whom He loves and who love Him who are humble towards the believers dignified to the unbelievers who strive hard for the cause of God and who have no fear of anyone s accusations This is a favor from God
He bestows His favors upon whomever He wants
God is Munificent and Allknowing
Only God His Messenger and the true believers who are steadfast in prayer and pay alms while they kneel during prayer are your guardians
One whose guardians are God His Messenger and the true believers should know that God s party will certainly triumph
Believers do not consider those among the People of the Book and the unbelievers who mock at your religion and treat it as useless as your protectors
Have fear of God if you are true believers
Because they are devoid of understanding they ridicule your call for prayers saying that it is a useless act
Muhammad say to the People of the Book Do you take revenge on us because of our belief in God and what He has revealed to us and to others before us Most of you are evildoers
Say Should I tell you who will receive the worst punishment from God
Those whom God has condemned afflicted with His anger made apes out of them swine and worshippers of Satan will have the worst dwelling and will wander far away from the right path
When they come to you believers they say We have accepted your faith
However they entered into your faith as unbelievers and left it as unbelievers
God knows best what they were hiding
You can see many of them competing with each other in sin hostility and in taking usury
What they had been doing is certainly evil
Why did the men of God and rabbis not forbid them from following their sinful words and their consuming of unlawful gains
Evil was their rabbis and priests profession
The Jews have said God s hands are bound
May they themselves be handcuffed and condemned for what they have said
God s hands are free and He distributes His favors to His creatures however He wants
The rebellion and disbelief of many of them will be intensified against you because of what has been revealed to you from your Lord
We have induced hostility and hatred among them which will remain with them up until the Day of Judgment
Whenever they kindle the fire of war God extinguishes it
They try to destroy the land but God does not love the evildoers
Had the People of the Book accepted the faith and observed piety certainly We would have redeemed their bad deeds and admitted them into a blissful Paradise
Had they followed the Laws of the Old and New Testaments and what was revealed to them from their Lord they would have received Our bounties from above and below in abundance
Some of them are modest people but many of them commit the worst sins
Messenger preach what is revealed to you from your Lord
If you will not preach it would be as though you have not conveyed My message
God protects you from men
He does not guide the unbelieving people
Muhammad tell the People of the Book You have nothing unless you follow the Old and New Testaments and that which the Quran God has revealed to you
Whatever has been revealed to you Muhammad from your Lord will only increase their disbelief and rebellion against you
Do not grieve for the unbelieving people
The believers Jews Sabaeans and the Christians who believe in God and the Day of Judgment and who do what is right will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
We made a covenant with the Israelites and sent Messengers to them
Whenever a Messenger came to them with a message which did not suit their desires they would reject some of the Messengers and kill others
They were blind and deaf in their pride thinking themselves to be the chosen nation of God and thus safe from calamities
God forgave them but many of them out of pride again became blind and deaf
God is Well Aware of what they do
Those who say that Jesus the son of Mary is God have in fact turned to disbelief
Jesus said to the Israelites Worship God my Lord and yours
God will deprive anyone who considers anything equal to God of Paradise and his dwelling will be fire
The unjust people have no helpers
Those who say that God is the third of the Three have in fact turned to disbelief
There is no Lord but God the only One Lord
If they will not giveup such belief the disbelievers among them will suffer a painful torment
Should they not repent and ask Him for forgiveness
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Jesus the son of Mary was no more than a Messenger before whom there lived many other Messengers
His mother was a truthful woman and both of them ate earthly food
Consider how We explain the evidence of the Truth to them and see where they then turn
Muhammad say to them Do you worship things besides God which can neither harm or benefit you
It is only God who is Allhearing and Allknowing
Say to the People of the Book Do not wrongly exceed the proper limit of devotion to your religion or follow the desires of the people who have erred
They have misled many others and have themselves stayed far away from the right path
The unbelievers among the Israelites because of their disobedience and transgression were condemned by David and Jesus the son of Mary for their disobedience they were transgressors
They did not prevent each other from committing sins nor would they themselves stay away from them
Evil was what they had done
You have seen many of them establishing friendship with the unbelievers
Vile is what their souls have gained They have invoked the wrath of God upon themselves and they will live forever in torment
Had they had faith in God the Prophet and what was revealed to him they would not have been the friends of the unbelievers
However many of them are evildoers
You find Jews and pagans among the worst of the enemies of the believers
Of the nonbelievers nearest to them the believers in affection you find those who say We are Christians for among them are the priests and monks who are not proud
When they hear what is revealed to the Messenger you can see their eyes flood with tears as they learn about the Truth
They say Lord we believe in this faith
Write our names down as bearing witness to it
Why should we not believe in God and the Truth that has come to us and hope that the Lord will admit us into the company of the righteous people
Thus God has given them as their reward gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
Such will be the recompense of the righteous people
Those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations will be the dwellers of Hell
Believers do not make unlawful the pure things which God has made lawful for you
Do not transgress for God does not love the transgressors
Eat from the pure and lawful things that God has given to you
Have fear of God in Whom you believe
God will not hold you responsible for your thoughtless oaths However He will question you about your deliberate oaths
The expiation for breaking an oath is to feed ten needy people with food typical of that which you feed to your own people to clothe them or to set a slave free
One who cannot pay this he must fast for three days to expiate his oaths
Keep your oaths
Thus does God explain His Laws so that you will give Him thanks
Believers wine gambling the stone altars and arrows that the pagans associate with certain divine characters are all abominable acts associated with satanic activities
Avoid them so that you may have everlasting happiness
Satan wants to induce hostility and hatred among you through wine and gambling and to prevent you from remembering God and prayer
Will you then avoid such things
Obey God and the Messenger and be cautious of the harmful things
If you turn away from Our laws know that the duty of the Messenger is only to preach in clear words
The righteously striving believers will not be blamed for what they have eaten if they maintain piety do good deeds have faith and be charitable
God loves the generous people
Believers God will test you to see the strength of your obedience concerning what you hunt by hand or spear so that He would know who has fear of Him in private
Whoever transgresses will suffer a painful torment
Believers do not hunt when you are in the holy precinct Whichever of you purposely kills game in the holy precinct has to offer as an expiation a sacrifice in the holy precinct which two just people among you would consider equal to the prey or food to a destitute person or has to fast for an appointed time to bear the burden of the penalty for his deed God forgives whatever was done in the past but He will take revenge on whoever returns to transgression for He is Majestic and Capable of taking revenge
It is lawful for you to hunt from the sea and to eat seafood This is for your benefit and for the benefit of travellers
However it is not lawful for you to hunt on land as long as you are in the sacred precinct
Have fear of God before whom you will all be raised
God has made the Kabah the Sacred House the sacred months the unmarked and marked sacrificial animals for the welfare of men and in order to inform you that God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth He has the knowledge of all things
Know that God is stern in His retribution and He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The duty of the Messenger is only to preach
God knows what you reveal or hide
Muhammad say to them The pure and filthy are not the same even though the abundance of filth may attract you
Men of reason have fear of God so that you may have eternal happiness
Believers do not ask about things which if revealed to you would disappoint you
If you ask about such things when the Prophet is receiving revelations they will also be revealed to you
God has exempted you from the responsibilities of the things you wanted to know
He is Allforgiving and Forbearing
People living before you had asked about such things but then rejected them
God has not instituted the rites of Bahirah Sa ibah Wasilah nor of Hami names of certain animals that the pagans would offer as sacrifice
It is the pagans who have attributed falsehood to God Many of them have no understanding
When they are told to refer to the guidance of God and to the Messenger they say The tradition of our fathers is sufficient for our guidance even though in fact their fathers had neither knowledge nor proper guidance
Believers save your own souls for if you have the right guidance no one who strays can harm you You will all return to God who will tell you about what you have done
Believers when death approaches any one of you let two just men from your own people Muslims or any two other men People of the Book if death befalls you on a journey bear witness to the bequest
If you have any doubts as to their honesty detain them and let them take an oath after the prayer each one of them saying I swear by God that my testimony is true I am not selling the Truth for a paltry price even though the beneficiary would be one of my relatives
I do not hide the testimony which is the right of God for then I would be one of the sinners
If their honesty is challenged two others from the relatives of the deceased should swear in the same way and testify to the bequest saying We swear by God that our testimony is the true one
We do not transgress in the matter lest we become unjust ones
This will help preserve a proper testimony because the witness will be afraid of the denial of their own testimony by a second pair of witness
Have fear of God and listen properly
God does not guide the evil doing people
Have fear of the day when God will bring all the Messengers together and ask them What was the response of men to your call
They will reply We have no knowledge
You are the only One who has knowledge of the unseen
When God said Jesus son of Mary recall My favors to you and your mother
Recall how I supported you by the holy spirit made you speak to people from your cradle and when you grew up taught you the Book gave you wisdom the Torah and the Gospel
Recall when by My will you made a sculpture of a bird out of clay blew into it and it turned into a real bird by My Will
Recall how by My will you healed the deaf the lepers and raised the dead
Recall when you came to the Israelites in the house with clear miracles and I saved you from their mischief even though the disbelievers among them said This is obviously magic
Recall when I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger
They said We have accepted the faith Lord bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to Your will
Recall when the disciples said Jesus son of Mary can your Lord send us a table full of food from heaven and you replied Have fear of God if you are true believers
They said We only wish to eat therefrom to comfort our hearts to know that you have spoken the Truth to us and to bear witness to it along with the others
When Jesus prayed Lord send us a table full of food from heaven so that it will make a feast for us and for those who are yet to come in this world and an evidence from You
Give us sustenance for You are the best Provider
God replied I am sending it to you but if anyone of you turns back to disbelief I will make him suffer a torment that no one has ever suffered
When God asked Jesus son of Mary Did you tell men to consider you and your mother as their gods besides God he replied Glory be to you
How could I say what I have no right to say
Had I ever said it You would have certainly known about it
You know what is in my soul but I do not know what is in Yours
It is You who has absolute knowledge of the unseen
I did not tell them anything except what You commanded me to tell them
I told them that they must worship God who is everyone s Lord
I watched them as long as I was among them until You raised me to Yourself and You Yourself had also watched over them You are Omnipresent
You may punish Your servants or forgive them for You are Majestic and Wise
God will say This is the Day when the truthful ones will benefit from their truthfulness
For them there are gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever
God is pleased with them and they will be pleased with God in their supreme triumph
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and He has power over all things
Only God Who has created the heavens the earth darkness and light deserves all praise
The disbelievers consider other things equal to Him
It is He who has created you from clay to live for a lifetime and the span of your life is only known to Him
You are still suspicious
He is God of the heavens and the earth and He knows whatever you conceal reveal or gain
The unbelievers have always turned away from the revelations and the evidence of the Truth that has been sent to them from time to time
They have refused the Truth Muhammad s message that has come to them but they will soon learn the consequences of their mocking
Why do they not consider how many generations living before them We have destroyed
We established those nations in the land with abilities far beyond those given to you
We sent down plenty of rain from the sky for them and made streams flow therein but then We destroyed them for their sins and established other nations after them
Muhammad had We sent you a Book on paper the unbelievers would have touched it with their hands but would still have said It is no more than plain sorcery
They have said Why has not an angel come to him Muhammad
Had We sent an angel to them the matter would have inevitably been out of their hands and they would have been given no more time
Were We to have made him Our Messenger an angel We would have made him resemble a human being and they would have again complained that the matter was as confusing to them as it is to them now
They mocked the Messengers who lived before you Muhammad but those who received warnings of punishment and mocked the warnings all suffered their torments accordingly
Muhammad tell them to travel in the land and see what happened to those who rejected the Truth
Ask them Who is the owner of the heavens and the earth besides God the Allmerciful who will gather you all together on the Day of Judgment
That day will certainly come
Those who have lost their souls will not believe
To Him belongs all that rests during the night and the day
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Muhammad ask them Should I take a guardian other than God the Originator of the heavens and the earth who feeds everyone and who needs no food Himself
Say I have been commanded to be the first Muslim submitted to the will of God Thus people do not be pagans
Muhammad say Because of the torment of the Great Day I am afraid to disobey my Lord
One who will be saved from the torment on the Day of Judgment will certainly have received God s mercy and this will be a manifest triumph
Muhammad if God afflicts you with hardship no one besides Him will be able to relieve you
If He bestows a favor on you know that He has power over all things
He is Wise Well Aware and Dominant over all His creatures
Muhammad ask them What is the greatest testimony
God testifies of my truthfulness to you
He has revealed this Quran to me to warn you and the coming generations against disobeying God
Do you believe that other gods exist besides God
I solemnly declare that He is the only Lord and that I am not guilty of believing in what the pagans believe
The People of the Book know him Muhammad just as well as they know their own children but those who have lost their souls will not believe
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God or reject His revelations
The unjust will certainly have no happiness
On the Day of Judgment when We will gather all people together We will ask the pagans Where are those whom you believed to be your gods
Attempting to answer they will say Lord we swear by Your Name that we were not pagans
Consider how they have lied against their own souls and have lost their gods
Some of them listen to you but We have veiled their hearts so that they cannot understand and made them deaf
They disbelieve all the evidence of Our existence that they may have seen
They only come to you for the sake of argument and the disbelievers say that whatever Muhammad says is no more than ancient legends
They keep away from the faith and forbid others to accept it
They destroy no one except themselves yet they do not realize it
If only you could see them standing in the fire saying Would that we could return to the worldly life We would never reject any of our Lord s revelations and we would be true believers
Whatever they had concealed will be revealed to them
If they were to return to the worldly life they would again worship idols for they are liars
They have said that this life is the only life and that there will be no Resurrection
Would that you could see them standing before their Lord who would ask them Is not the Resurrection true
They would reply Yes Lord there is a Resurrection
The Lord would then say For your disbelief suffer the torment
Those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment have incurred upon themselves a great loss
When the Day of Judgment suddenly comes upon them they will sink under the burden of their sins in grief for their neglecting that day
Terrible indeed will be their burden
The worldly life is but useless amusement and sport compared to the life hereafter which is far better and is only for the pious
Will you not then understand
We certainly know that you Muhammad are sad about what they the unbelievers say
It is not you alone who has been accused of lying
The unjust have always rejected God s revelations
The Messengers who lived before you were also accused of lying but they exercised patience
They were cruelly persecuted before We gave them victory No one can change the words of God
You have already received news about the Messengers
Muhammad if their refusal of the faith is so grievous to you and if you can dig up the earth or ascend into the sky in search of further evidence to inevitably make them believe you you should have done so but note that had God wanted He could have made them all follow the same guidance
Do not ever be unaware of this fact
Only those who have understanding will accept your faith
Those who have no understanding are like the dead whom God will resurrect and to Him will all return
They say Why have not some miracles been given to him Muhammad from his Lord
Tell them Muhammad God certainly has the Power to show such miracles but many of them are ignorant
All the beasts on land and flying birds have different communities just as you people do
Nothing is left without a mention in the Book
They will all be brought into the presence of their Lord
Those who disbelieve Our revelations are in fact deaf and dumb They wander in darkness
God leads astray or guides to the right path whomever He wants
Muhammad say to them Should God afflict you with torment or should the Day of Judgment arrive if what you claim is true could you then seek help from any one other than God
You will certainly ask Him for help
He will save you from hardship if He decides to do so and you will forget all about your gods
We had sent Our guidance to the nations who lived before you and afflicted them with distress and adversity so that they might submit themselves to God
Why did they not submit themselves to God when Our torment struck them
Instead their hearts were hardened and Satan made their evil deeds seem attractive to them
When they forgot all the advice that they had received We granted them all means of happiness but they were left in despair when We suddenly took Our bounties back from them
Thus the transgressing people were destroyed
It is only God the Lord of creation who deserves all praise
Muhammad ask them Have you ever considered that if God was to disable your hearing and vision and veil your hearts could anyone besides Him restore them
Look at how plainly We show them the evidence of the Truth but they always ignore it
Tell them Have you considered that if God s torment was to befall you suddenly or in public would anyone else be destroyed except the unjust
We did not send the Messengers for any other reason than to bring people the glad news of God s mercy and to warn them of the torment brought on by disobedience to God
Whoever accepts the faith and lives a righteous life will have nothing to fear nor will he be grieved
Those who reject Our revelations will certainly be punished for their evil deeds
Muhammad tell them I do not claim to have all the treasures of God in my hands nor to know the unseen nor do I claim to be an angel
I follow only what is revealed to me from God
Say to them Are the blind and the seeing equal
Why then do you not think
Preach the Quran to those who are concerned about the Day of Judgment at which time they will be brought before their Lord
Tell them that their only guardian and intercessor is God so that they may become pious
Do not disregard those who pray to their Lord in the mornings and evenings seeking their Lord s pleasure
You will not be held responsible for them nor will they be held responsible for you
Do not disregard them lest you become unjust
We test some of them by the conditions of the others so that the rich and proud ones seeing your poor and humble followers would say Are these the ones from among all of us whom God has chosen to favor
Does not God know those who give thanks much better than others do
When the faithful come to you say to them Peace be upon you
Your Lord has decreed for Himself to be Allmerciful Anyone of you who commits a sin out of ignorance then repents and reforms himself will find that God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Thus do We explain Our revelations so that the sinful way can be plainly discerned
Muhammad tell them I am commanded not to worship the idols instead of God
I do not follow your desires lest I go astray and miss the true guidance
Say I have received enough authoritative evidence from my Lord but you have rejected it
Whatever torment that God has threatened you with for your disbelief and that which you insist on to experience without delay is not in my hands
The final Judgment is in the hands of God
He reveals the Truth and He is the best Judge
Say If I had in my hands what you demand to experience without delay the matter would have been ended all together God knows best about the unjust
He has with Him the keys to the unseen which no one knows besides Him
He knows all that is in the land and the sea
Not a single leaf falls which He would not know
No single seed exists even in the darkest places of the land nor anything in the world either wet or dry that is not kept recorded in the selfevident Book the tablet preserved in the heavens
It is He who keeps you alive in your sleep at night and knows all that you do during the day
He wakes you up from your sleep to complete your worldly life after which you will all return to Him
He will let you know all about what you had done in your worldly life
He is Dominant over all His creatures and He sends guards to watch over you until death approaches you
Then His angelic Messengers will without fail take away your souls
After death you will all be returned to God your true Guardian
Know that judgment will be in His Hands and that His reckoning is swift
Muhammad ask them Who would save you from the darkness of the land and sea if you were to pray humbly and secretly saying Would that we were saved from this for we would certainly then give thanks
Say It is God who always saves you from such hardship and from all kinds of distress
Even then you consider idols equal to God
Say God has the power to send torment on you from above or below your feet or to divide you into different groups quite hostile to one another and make you suffer from each other s animosity
Consider how plainly We show them a variety of evidence of the Truth so that they may have understanding
Some of your people have rejected the Quran although it is the Truth
Tell them that you are not their guardian
and that for every prophecy about you which comes from God there is an appointed time to come true and that they will soon experience it
When you see people mocking Our revelations turn away from them so that they may change the subject
If Satan causes you to forget this do not sit with the unjust people when you remember
But those who observe piety commit no sin by sitting with the unbelievers in order to preach the Truth so that they too may become pious
Muhammad leave alone those to whom their religion is no more than a useless plaything and who are deceived by the lure of the worldly life
Remind them of Our revelation so that a soul will not bring about its own destruction because of its deeds
No one besides God will be its guardian or intercessor nor will any kind of ransom be accepted from it
Those who have entangled themselves in their evil deeds will drink boiling water and live in painful torment for their hiding the Truth
Say to them Should we instead of asking for God s help seek help from that which can neither benefit nor harm us but would only turn us back to disbelief after God had granted us guidance To do so would be to act like those who have been seduced by Satan leaving them wandering aimlessly here and there even though their friends call them Come to the right guidance that has come to us
Say God s guidance is the only true guidance and we are commanded to submit ourselves to the Lord of the Universe
Be steadfast in prayer and have fear of God before Him alone you will all be brought together
It is He Who has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
When He commands the Day of Judgment to take place it will come into existence
His Word is the Truth
The kingdom will be His alone on the day when the trumpet will be sounded
He has all knowledge of the unseen as well as the seen
He is Allwise and Allaware
Consider when Abraham asked his father Azar Why do you believe idols to be your gods
I find you and your people in absolute error
Also We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth to strengthen his faith
When it became dark at night he Abraham saw a star and said This is my lord
But when it disappeared he said I do not love those who fade away
When Abraham saw the rising moon he said This is my lord
But when it faded away he said If my Lord does not guide me I shall certainly go astray
When he saw the rising sun he said This is my Lord for it is greater than the others
But when this too faded away Abraham said My people I disavow whatever you consider equal to God
I have uprightly submitted myself to the One who has created the heavens and the earth and I am not an idol worshipper
In an argument with his people Abraham asked them Why do you argue with me about God who has given me guidance
Your idols can do no harm to me unless God wills
God knows all things
Why then do you not consider this
Why should I be afraid of your idols when you are not afraid of worshipping them without any authority from heaven
Would that you knew which of us is more deserving to receive amnesty
Those who have accepted the faith and have kept it pure from injustice have achieved security and guidance
Such was the authoritative reasoning that We gave Abraham over his people
We raise whomever We want to a higher rank
Your Lord is Allwise and Allknowing
We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Both had received Our guidance
Noah received Our guidance before Abraham and so did his descendants David Solomon Job Joseph Moses and Aaron
Thus is the reward for the righteous people
We also gave guidance to Zacharias John Jesus and Elias who were all pious people
and Ishmael Elisha Jonah and Lot whom We exalted over all people
From their fathers descendants and brothers We chose certain people and guided them to the right path
Such is the guidance of God by which He guides whichever of His servants He wants
If people worship idols their deeds will be turned devoid of all virtue
These were the people to whom We gave the Book Authority and Prophesy
If some people do not accept Our guidance it should not grieve you Muhammad for We have made others who accept and protect Our guidance
We had guided the Prophets
Muhammad follow their guidance and say to the people I do not ask any reward for what I have preached to you
It is my duty to awaken the world
They have no true respect of God when they say God has not sent anything to a mortal being
Muhammad tell them Who revealed the Book containing a light and guidance for the people which Moses brought
You wrote down only some parts of the original on paper and hid much even after having learnt from it that which neither you nor your fathers knew
Tell them God has revealed the Quran and then leave them alone to pursue their useless investigations
We have blessed this Book the Quran and revealed it to confirm that which was revealed to the Prophets who lived before you and to warn the people of the mother land Mecca and those living around it
Those who believe in the Day of Judgment accept this and are steadfast in their prayers
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe lies to God or say that God has sent them revelations when nothing has been sent to them or those who say that they can also bring down from heaven a book like that which God has revealed
Would that you could see the unjust in the agonies of death when the angels will come forward with their hands outstretched to take their souls out of their bodies and say This is the day when you will face humiliating torment for the falsehood that you ascribed to God and for your contemptuously disregarding of His revelations
God will say You have come to Us alone just as We created you at first You have left behind all those whom We made your friends and We do not see with you any of the intercessors whom you believed to be your partners
Your relations with them have certainly been destroyed and your belief in them has left you in the dark
It is God who makes all kinds of seeds grow brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living
It is God who does such things so how can you turn away from Him
It is He who kindles the light of dawn and has made the night for you to rest and the sun and moon as a means of calculation
This is the design of the Majestic and Allknowing God
It is God who created the stars so that you could find your way thereby in the darkness of the land and sea
We have explained Our evidence to the people of knowledge
It is He who has created you from a single soul
Some of you are settled on earth and some are still in the depository system of their parents
We have shown the evidence of Our existence to the people who understand
It is He who has sent water down from the sky to let all kinds of plants grow the vegetables with accumulated grains palmtrees from which appear clusters of dates within easy reach vineyards olive groves and pomegranates of all types
See the fruits when they are growing and when they are ripe
This too is evidence of the existence of God for those who believe
Some people considered the jinn to be equal to God even though God created them and they unknowingly ascribed to Him children both boys and girls
God is too glorious to have the attributes which they ascribe to Him
How could the One Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and who has no companion have a son
He created all things and has absolute knowledge of all things
He is God your Lord
There is no God but He
He has created all things
Worship Him for He is the Guardian of all things
No mortal eyes can see Him but He can see all eyes
He is Allkind and Allaware
Muhammad tell them Clear proofs have certainly come to you from your Lord
Whoever tries to understand it will gain much but those who ignore it will only harm themselves
I am not supposed to watch over you all the time
Thus do We explain Our revelations to them Let them say You have learned those statements from other people
We want to explain Our revelations only to those who have knowledge
Muhammad follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord there is no God but He and stay away from pagans
Had God wanted they would not consider anything equal to Him
God has not appointed you to watch over them nor are you their guardian
Believers do not say bad words against the idols lest they pagans in their hostility and ignorance say such words against God
We have made every nation s deeds seem attractive to them
One day they will all return to their Lord who will inform them of all that they have done
The unbelievers solemnly swear by God that if they were to be shown some miracle they would certainly believe
Muhammad tell them Only with God are all the miracles
Even if a miracle was to take place they still would not believe
We will turn their hearts and vision away from a miracle they did not have faith in miracles at the first time and We will leave them blind in their rebellion
Had We sent the angels to them made the dead speak to them and resurrected all things before their very eyes they still would not believe unless God willed it to be so
But in fact most of them ignore the evidence
We have made devilish enemies for every Prophet from among people and jinn
They whisper attractive but and deceitful words to each other
Had your Lord wanted the devils would not have seduced people
Keep away from them and the falsehood which they invent
Let those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment listen to the deceitful words with pleasure and indulge in whatever sins they want
Muhammad say Should I seek any judge other than God It is He Who has revealed this Book Quran to you with all its intricate details
Those to whom We have given the Bible know that the Quran has been revealed to you from your Lord in all Truth
Thus you people must have no doubts about it
After having revealed the Quran to you in all truth and justice your Lord s Word has been completed
No one can change His Words
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Most of the people in the land will lead you away from God s guidance if you follow them they only follow their own conjecture and preach falsehood
Your Lord knows best those who have gone astray from His path and those who are rightly guided
If you have faith in God s revelations eat the flesh of the animal which has been slaughtered with a mention of His Name
Why should you not eat such flesh when God has told you in detail what is unlawful to eat under normal conditions
Most people out of ignorance are led astray by their desires
Your Lord knows best those who transgress
Stay away from both public and secret sins for a sinner will suffer for whatever he has committed
Do not eat the flesh of an animal which has been slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God it is a sinful deed
Satan teaches his friends to argue with you
If you obey them you will certainly be idol worshippers
Can the dead to whom We have given life and light so that they may walk among the people be considered equal to those who can never come out of darkness
The deeds of the unbelievers are made to seem attractive to them
In every town We have placed some sinful leaders who always make evil plans
These plans will only work against their own souls but they do not realize this
When a miracle is shown to them they say We will not believe unless we are shown a miracle like that shown to the messengers of God
God knows best whom to appoint as His Messenger
The sinful ones are worthless in the sight of God and they deserve a severe punishment for their evil plans
God will open the hearts of whomever He wants to guide to Islam but He will tighten the chest of one whom He has led astray as though he was climbing high up into the sky
Thus God places wickedness on those who do not accept the faith
This is the path of your Lord and it is straight
We have explained Our revelations to those who take heed
They will live in peace with God
God protects them as a reward for their deeds He is their Guardian
On the day when every one will be resurrected and the jinn will be told that they have made many people go astray their friends from among people will say Lord we benefitted from each other until death approached us They will be told that their dwelling will be fire wherein they will live forever unless God wills it to be otherwise Your Lord is Allwise and Allknowing
Thus do We make the unjust friends of one another because of their evil deeds
When people and jinn are asked Did not Messengers from your own people come to you to convey Our revelations and to warn you of the Day of Resurrection
They will reply Yes indeed
The worldly life deceived them
They will testify that they were unbelievers
Your Lord did not want to destroy the towns unjustly without informing their inhabitants of His guidance
People s deeds are of different degrees and your Lord is not unaware of what people do
Your Lord is Selfsufficient and Merciful
Had He wanted He could have destroyed you and replaced you by other people just as He had created you from the offspring of others
Whatever you are promised will inevitably come true and you can do nothing to prevent it
Muhammad tell your people I shall do whatever I can and you may do whatever you want but you will soon know who will be victorious It is certain that the unjust will never have happiness
They set aside a share of the leftovers of their farming produce and cattle saying This is for God and that is for the idols
God does not receive the share of the idols but the share of God is given totally to the idols
How terrible is their decision
To many of the pagans the murder of their children was made to seem attractive by the idols This led them the pagans to confusion in their religion and to face their own destruction
Had God wanted they would not have murdered their children
Keep away from them and their evil gains
They the pagans have said that their cattle and farms are dedicated to private idols and that no one can consume the produce except those whom We wanted in their opinion
They prohibited the riding of certain animals and they ate the flesh of certain animals slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God
Instead they ascribed falsehood to Him
They will all be given an evil recompense for their sinful invention
They have also said Whatever exists in the wombs of these animals belongs to our people alone and it is not lawful for our women
However if they are born dead then everyone will have a share
God will give them what they deserve for their unjust laws
God is Allmerciful and Allknowing
Those who foolishly and ignorantly murdered their children ascribed falsehood to God and made unlawful what He had given to them for their sustenance have certainly lost much
They had gone far away from the right guidance
It is He who has created all kinds of gardens those raised on trellises and those without palmtrees and the crops of different seasons and olives and pomegranates of all types
You may eat their fruits that they produce but pay God s share on the harvest day Do not be excessive for God does not love those who are excessive
God has created animals both small and large
Eat from what God has given you for your sustenance and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan
He is your sworn enemy
Supposing that there are eight pairs of cattle two pairs of sheep and two pairs of goats
Tell Me which is lawful and which is not
Are the two males unlawful to eat or the two females or those that are in the wombs of the females If you are truthful then answer Me exactly
Of the two pairs of camels and cows are the males unlawful to eat or the females or that which exists in the wombs of the females
Were you present when God commanded you to do this
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God and out of ignorance make others go astray
God does not guide the unjust
Muhammad tell them I do not find anything which has been made unlawful to eat in what has been revealed to me except carrion blood flowing from the body pork for pork is absolutely filthy and the flesh of the animals slaughtered without the mention of the name of God
However in an emergency when one does not have any intention of rebelling or transgressing against the law your Lord will be Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We made unlawful for the Jews all the clawfooted animals fat of the cows sheep and goats except what is found on their backs intestines and whatever is mixed with their bones
Thus did We recompense them for their rebellion and We are certainly truthful
They reject you Muhammad tell them Your Lord s mercy is completely overwhelming but no one can save the sinful from His wrath
The pagans will say Had God wanted we would not have worshipped idols nor would our fathers nor would we have made anything unlawful
Others before them had also spoken such lies until they experienced the severity of Our wrath
Muhammad ask them Do you possess any knowledge If so tell us about it
You follow only conjectures and preach falsehood
Say Final authority belongs only to God
Had He wanted He would have given you all guidance
Ask them to call their witness who will testify that God has made certain things unlawful
Even if they do testify do not testify with them Do not follow the desires of those who have rejected Our revelations and the pagans who do not believe in the Day of Judgment
Muhammad say Let me tell you about what your Lord has commanded Do not consider anything equal to God Be kind to your parents Do not murder your children out of fear of poverty for We give sustenance to you and to them
Do not even approach indecency either in public or in private
Take not a life which God has made sacred except by way of justice and law
Thus does He command you that you may learn wisdom
Do not handle the property of the orphans except with a good reason until they become mature and strong
Maintain equality in your dealings by the means of measurement and balance
No soul is responsible for what is beyond it s ability
Be just in your words even if the party involved is one of your relatives and keep your promise with God
Thus does your Lord guide you so that you may take heed
This is My path and it is straight
Follow it and not other paths which will lead you far away from the path of God
Thus does God guide you so that you may become pious
We gave Moses the Book to complete Our favor for the righteous ones the Book that contained a detailed explanation of all things a guide and a mercy so that perhaps they would have faith in the Day of Judgment
This Book Quran which We have revealed is a blessed one
Follow its guidance and have piety so that you perhaps may receive mercy
and will not say that the Book was revealed only to two groups of people before you or that you were ignorant of its knowledge
or proclaim Had the Book been revealed to us we would have followed its guidance better than the Jews and Christians
Evidence guidance and mercy have already come to you from your Lord
Who are more unjust than those who reject God s revelations and turn away from them
We will give an evil recompense to those who turn away from Our revelations and a terrible torment for their disregard of Our guidance
Are they waiting until the angels or your Lord come to them or for some miracles to take place
On the day when some miracles of God will take place the belief of any soul will be of no avail to it unless some good deeds have been done with it or it has been formed before the coming of such a day
Muhammad tell them Wait and we too are waiting
Some of those who have divided their religion into different sects are not your concern
Their affairs are in the hands of God Who will show them all that they have done
For a single good deed one will be rewarded tenfold
But the recompense for a bad deed will be equal to that of the deed and no injustice will be done to anyone
Muhammad tell them My Lord has guided me to the right path a well established religion and the upright tradition of Abraham who was not a pagan
Say My prayer sacrifice life and death are all for God the Lord of the Universe
Nothing is equal to Him
Thus are the commandments which I have received and he is the first Muslim submitted to the will of God
Muhammad tell them Should I take a lord besides God when He is the Lord of all things
All one s evil deeds are against one s own soul
No one will be considered responsible for another s sins
You will all be returned to your Lord who will tell you what is right and wrong in disputed matters among you
On earth We have made each of your generations the successors of their predecessors We have made some of you do good deeds of a higher degree than others
He will test you in this way through what He has revealed to you Your Lord s retribution is swift and He is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Alif Lam
A book has been revealed to you Muhammad
You should not hesitate to convey its warning and its good advice to the believers
People follow whatever is revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other guardians besides Him
However you pay very little attention to Our words
How many cities have We destroyed
Our wrath struck their people at night or during their midday siesta
When Our wrath struck them they could do nothing but confess to their sins
We will certainly question the people and the Messengers sent to them
We will tell them with absolute certainty what they had done for We had never been absent from them during their lifetime
Everyone s deeds will certainly be weighed and evaluated on the Day of Judgment
Those whose good deeds weigh heavier than their bad deeds will have everlasting happiness
As for those whose bad deeds weigh heavier they will lose their souls for their injustice to Our revelations
We have made you inhabit the land and provided you with the means of sustenance
Only a few of you give thanks
We created and shaped you then told the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam
All the angels obeyed except Satan who did not
God asked What made you disobey Me
Satan replied I am better than Adam for You have created me out of fire and Adam out of clay
The Lord ordered Satan to get out of Paradise saying This is no place for you to be proud
Get out of this place for you are worthless
Satan asked the Lord to give him respite keep him alive until the Day of Resurrection
The Lord told him We will grant you this respite
Then Satan said Because you have made me go astray I shall certainly try to seduce people into straying from the right path
I shall attack them from all directions and You will not find many of them giving You thanks
The Lord told Satan Get out of this garden for you are banished and despised
Hell will be filled with all of those who follow you
Then the Lord said Adam stay in the garden with your spouse and eat whatever you want therein but do not go near this tree lest you transgress
Satan tempted them to reveal that which was kept private from them and said Your Lord has not prohibited you to eat the fruits of this tree unless you want to be angels or immortal
Satan swore before them that he was giving them good advice
Thus he deceitfully showed them the tree
When they had tasted fruits from the tree their private parts became revealed to them and they began to cover their private parts with leaves from the garden
Their Lord then called out to them saying Did I not forbid you to eat fruits from the tree and tell you that Satan was your sworn enemy
They replied Lord we have done injustice to our souls
If You will not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall certainly have incurred a great loss
The Lord told them to leave the garden as each other s enemies and go to earth to dwell and benefit from the means therein for an appointed time
He told them that on earth they would live die and be resurrected
Children of Adam We have given you clothing to cover your private parts and for beauty but the robe of piety is the best
Thus is the guidance of God so that you may take heed
Children of Adam do not let Satan seduce you as he caused your parents to be expelled from the garden and made them take off their clothes in order to show them their private parts
Satan and those like him see you but you do not see them
We have made the Satans as friends for those who have no faith
When The faithless commit indecent acts they say We found our fathers doing this and God has commanded us to do the same
Muhammad tell them that God does not command anyone to commit indecency
Do you speak for God saying things of which you have no knowledge
Say My Lord has ordered me to maintain justice
People pay due attention when worshipping God
Pray to Him sincerely and be devoted in your religion
Just as He gave you life He will bring you back to life again after you die
He has guided one group of people and the other group go is doomed to astray the latter group took Satan as their guardian instead of God and thought that they were rightly guided
Children of Adam dress well when attending the mosques eat and drink but do not be excessive for God does not love those who are excessive in what they do
Muhammad ask them Who has made it unlawful to maintain beauty and to eat the pure foods which God has created for His servants
They are made for the believers in this world and are exclusively for them in the life hereafter
Thus do We explain Our revelations to the people who have knowledge
Muhammad tell them My Lord has only prohibited indecent acts committed in public or in secret all sins unjust rebellion considering things equal to God without any heavenly authority and speaking for God without having any knowledge of what He has said
All people can only live for an appointed time When their term ends they will not remain alive even for a single hour nor will they die before the appointed time
Children of Adam when Messengers from among your own people come to you to preach My revelations those who choose piety and reform themselves will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
But those who have rejected Our revelations out of pride will be the dwellers of hell fire wherein they will live forever
Who are more unjust than those who invent falsehoods against God and reject His revelations
These will have their share of torment which is ordained for them and when Our angelic Messengers come to them to cause them to die and ask them Where are those whom you had been worshipping besides God they will reply We had gone astray from the path of God Thus they will testify against their own souls by confessing their disbelief
On the Day of Judgment the Lord will say to them Join the group of jinn and people who lived before you in hell
Each group on entering hell will curse the other dwellers until all of them are brought together therein
The last group will accuse the first saying Lord they made us go astray
Therefore double their torment in the Fire
The Lord will reply For everyone of you there is a double torment but you do not know it
The first will then say You are no better than us suffer the torment as the result of your deeds
For those who have rejected Our revelations out of pride no door to the heavens will be opened nor will they be admitted into Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a sewing needle
Thus do We recompense the criminals
For them hell will be both a cradle and a blanket
Thus do We punish the unjust
The righteously striving believers We do not impose on any soul that which is beyond its ability are the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We shall remove all grudges from their hearts
They will enjoy the flowing streams in the garden and will say God who guided us to this deserves all praise
Had He not guided us we would never have been able to find the right direction
The angelic Messengers of our Lord came to us with the Truth
They shall be told This is the Paradise which you have inherited because of your good deeds
The people of Paradise will say to the dwellers of the fire We have found whatever our Lord promised has come true
Have you found whatever the Lord promised you to be true
They will reply Yes we have also found it to be true Thereupon someone will cry out God has condemned the unjust
who prevented others from the way of God sought to make the path appear crooked and had no belief in the Day of Judgment
There will be a barrier between the people of Paradise and hell There will be people on the heights who know everyone by their faces and who will say to the people of Paradise Peace be upon you
They hope to enter Paradise but are not yet therein
When their eyes turn to the dwellers of hell they will pray Lord do not place us among the unjust
The people of the Heights will say to those in hell whose faces they recognize Why did your supporters and your pride not help you
They will also say Are these the people of Paradise the ones of whom you swore would receive no mercy from God
They will continue People of Paradise live therein without any fear or grief
The dwellers of the fire will ask the people of Paradise to give them some water or other things which God has granted to them
They will reply God has deprived the unbelievers of the blessings of Paradise
On that Day We will neglect those who were deceived by the worldly life and who treated their religion as a useless game because they had forgotten such a day and rejected Our revelations
We have revealed the Book of guidance and mercy to the believers and We know all of its details
Despite the clear details of Our guidance in the Book do they still wait for further interpretations
On the Day of Judgment when its interpretations will be revealed those who had ignored its guidance will confess saying The Messengers of our Lord had certainly come to us with the Truth
Will anyone intercede for us or send us back to life so that we would be able to act in a different manner to that which we had done before
These people have certainly lost their souls and their evil inventions which they had used for false excuses will vanish
Your Lord is God who established His dominion over the Throne of the realm after having created the heavens and the earth in six days He made the night darken the day which it pursues at a considerable speed and He made the sun and the moon submissive to His command
Is it not He Who creates and governs all things
Blessed is God the Cherisher of the Universe
Pray to your Lord humbly and privately
God does not love the transgressors
Do not destroy the land after it has been well established but pray to God have fear of Him and hope to receive His mercy
God s mercy is close to the righteous people
God sends the wind bearing the glad news of His mercy
When heavy clouds are formed We drive them unto a barren country and rain down on it water to cause all kinds of fruits to grow
In the same way do We bring the dead to life again
Perhaps you would take heed
A good land produces plants by the permission of its Lord but a wicked land produces only miserable bitter plants
Thus do We show a variety of evidence for those who give thanks
We sent Noah to his people
He told them Worship God for He is your only Lord
I am afraid of the punishment that you might suffer on the great Day of Judgment
A group of his people said to him You are absolutely wrong
Noah said My people I am not in any error rather I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Universe
sent to preach to you the message of my Lord and to give you good advice
I know what you do not know about God
Does it seem strange to you that a reminder from your Lord should be sent to a man from among you to warn you so that you might receive mercy
They accused him of telling lies
So We saved him and his companions in an ark and drowned those who called Our revelations mere lies
They were no doubt a blind people
We sent Hud to his brethren the tribe of Ad who told them Worship God for He is your only Lord Will you not become pious
A group of the unbelievers among his people said You look to us like a fool and we think that you are a liar
He replied My people I am not a fool but a Messenger of the Lord of the Universe
I preach the message of my Lord to you and am a trustworthy advisor for you
Does it seem strange to you that a reminder from your Lord should be sent to a man among you so that He may warn you
Recall when God appointed you as successors of the people of Noah and increased your power over other people
Give thanks to God for His blessings so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
They said Have you come to make us worship God alone and give up what our fathers worshipped
If you are truthful let the torment with which you have threatened us strike us
He replied You will certainly be afflicted by wickedness and the wrath of God
Do you dispute with me about the names of that which you and your fathers have invented
God has given no authority to those names
Wait for God s decree and I too am waiting with you
Through Our mercy We saved him and his companions and destroyed the unbelievers who called Our revelations mere lies
We sent Salih to his brethren the tribe of Thamud who told them Worship God your only Lord
Authoritative evidence has come to you from your Lord and this shecamel is the evidence for you from God
Let her graze in the land of God
Do not give her any trouble lest a painful torment will strike you
Recall the time when We settled you in the land as the heirs of the tribe of Ad and how you established mansions in the plains and carved homes out of the mountains
Give thanks to God for His favors and do not commit evil in the land
The proud ones among Salih s people asked his oppressed followers Do you really know that Salih is a Messenger of his Lord
They replied We have faith in the Message which he preaches
The proud oppressors said We reject that which you believe in
They then slew the camel and rebelled against the orders of their Lord saying Salih if you are truly a Messenger let that torment with which you have threatened us come to pass
Suddenly an earthquake jolted them and they were left motionless in their homes
He turned away from them saying My people I preached the Message of my Lord to you and gave you good advice but you do not love advisors
Lot told his people Why do you commit such indecent acts that have never been committed by anyone before
You engage in lustful activities with people instead of women
You have become transgressing people
His people had no answer to his remarks but to tell one another Expel him from our town he and his people want to purify themselves
We saved Lot and his family except his wife who remained with the rest
We sent a torrential rain unto the unbelievers
Consider how disastrous the end of the criminals was
We sent to the people of Midian their brother Shu ayb who also told his people to worship God their only Lord
He said A guidance has come to you from your Lord
Maintain proper measures and weights in trade
Do not cause any deficiency in people s property or destroy the land after it has been reformed
This is for your own good if you have any faith
Do not ambush the believers or hinder them from every path that leads them to God just because you wish to make such ways seem crooked
Recall the time when you were just a few in number and God multiplied you
Consider how terrible the end of the evildoers was
If there are some of you who believe in the Message that I have been commanded to preach and there are others who do not exercise patience until God judges among us
He is the best Judge
A proud group among Shu ayb s people said We must expel you Shu ayb and your followers from our town unless you giveup your faith and live as our own people
Shu ayb asked them Will you use force against us
We would certainly be inventing falsehoods against God if we were to accept your way of life when God has already saved us from it
We do not have to accept it unless God our Lord wills it
Our Lord s knowledge covers all things
We trust in Him and ask Him to judge among us and our people for He is the best Judge
A group of the unbelievers among his people told the others If you follow Shu ayb you will certainly lose a great deal
Suddenly an earthquake struck them and left them motionless in their homes
Those who called Shu ayb a liar were destroyed as though they never existed
They certainly were the ones to lose a great deal
He turned away from them saying My people I preached the Message of my Lord to you and gave you good advice
How could I be sorry for the unbelievers
To every town that We sent a Prophet We tested its inhabitants through distress and adversity so that perhaps they would submit themselves to Us
We then replaced their misfortune with wellbeing until they were relieved and began saying Our fathers had also experienced good and bad days
Suddenly We struck them with torment while they were all unaware of what was happening
Had the people of the towns believed in Our revelations and maintained piety We would have certainly showered on them Our blessings from the sky and the earth
But they called Our revelations lies thus Our torment struck them for their evil deeds
Did the people of the towns think themselves secure from Our wrath that could strike them at night during their sleep
or that which could seize them during their busy hours of the day
Did they consider themselves secure from the retribution of God
No one can have such attitude except those who are lost
Is it not a lesson for the successors of the past generations that had We wanted We could have punished them for their sins sealed their hearts and deprived them of hearing
Muhammad such were the stories of the people who lived in different towns in the past
We had sent Our Messengers to them with certain miracles but the people still did not believe in what they had rejected before
Such is how God seals the hearts of the unbelievers
We did not find many among them keeping their promises
However We did find many evildoers among them
After the time of those people We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his people but they too rejected Our miracles
Consider how terrible the end of the evildoers is
Moses told the Pharaoh I am a Messengers from the Lord of the Universe
I must only speak what is true about God
I have brought you miracles from your Lord therefore let the children of Israel go free
The Pharaoh asked Moses to show his miracles if he was telling the truth
So Moses threw down his staff and suddenly it turned into a real serpent
Then he uncovered his hand and it appeared sheer white to the onlookers
Some of the Pharaoh s nobles considered him to be no more than a skillful magician
and said He wants to expel you from your land
They asked others what is your opinion in the matter
The others suggested holding Moses and his brother off and sending to all the cities
to bring together at the Pharaohs court all the skillful magicians
The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said We must have our reward if we are to gain a victory over him Moses
The Pharaoh replied In addition to your rewards you will become my close friends thereafter
The magicians asked Moses Will you throw your staff first or shall we
He replied Throw yours first
Their great magic bewitched people s eyes and terrified them
We inspired Moses to throw his staff and suddenly it began to swallowup all that the magicians had falsely invented
Thus the Truth prevailed and their false art was banished
The magicians who were defeated on the spot and were proved to be worthless
threw themselves down in prostration
saying We declare our belief in the Lord of the Universe
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said to the magicians You declared your belief in him Moses without my permission This is a plot to throw my people out of their city
But you will soon know
I will cut off your hands and feet on the alternate sides and crucify you all
The magicians said We will certainly return to Our Lord
You only take revenge on us because we believed in the Lord when we saw His miracles
Lord grant us patience and let us die Muslims submitted to God
Some of the Pharaohs people said Will you let Moses and his people destroy the land and disregard you and your gods
The Pharaoh said We will kill their sons and leave their women alive they are under our domination
Moses told his people to seek help from God and exercise patience
The earth belongs to Him and He has made it the heritage of whichever of His servants He chooses
The final victory is for the pious ones
His people said We suffered a great deal before you came and we are still suffering even after you have come
Moses tried to encourage them by saying There is hope that your Lord will destroy your enemies and make you their successors in the land So consider how you act
For years We afflicted Pharaoh s people with shortages in food so that perhaps they would take heed
But they would always ascribe their wellbeing to themselves and the misfortunes that they would experience to Moses and his people
Their fate is certainly in the hands of God but many of them do not know
They said to Moses No matter what miracle you show to bewitch us we will not believe you
We sent upon them widespread calamities floods of locusts lice frogs and blood
All were distinct miracles but these criminals all the time remained proud
When the torment would strike them they would ask Moses Pray for us to your Lord through your covenant with Him
If He saves us from the torment we shall certainly believe in you and permit you and the children of Israel to leave
But when We relieved them from the torment for a given time they again broke their promise
We took revenge on them for their rejecting Our miracles by drowning them in the sea but they were not aware of reality
We gave the suppressed people the blessed eastern and western regions as their inheritance
Thus the promises of your Lord to the children of Israel all came true because of the patience which they exercised
He destroyed all the establishments of the Pharaoh and his people
We helped the children of Israel to cross the sea
They came to a people who worshipped idols
The Israelites demanded Moses to make gods for them like those of the idolworshippers
Moses told them You are an ignorant people
What these people worship is doomed to be destroyed and their deeds are based on falsehood
Should I choose for you a lord other than God who has favored you above all other people
Children of Israel when I saved you from the Pharaoh and his people who made you suffer the worst kinds of torment killing your sons and keeping your women alive it was a great trial for you from your Lord
We told Moses to stay with Us for thirty nights in the mountains but added ten nights more so his appointment with his Lord came to an end after forty nights
Moses had appointed his brother Aaron as his deputy among his people during his absence saying Try to reform them and do not follow the way of the evildoers
During the appointment the Lord spoke to Moses
He asked the Lord to show Himself so that he could look at Him
The Lord replied You can never see Me
But look at the mountain
If the mountain remains firm only then will you see Me
When the Lord manifested His Glory to the mountain He turned it into dust and Moses fell down upon his face senseless
After regaining his senses Moses said Lord You are all Holy
I repent for what I asked you to do and I am the first to believe in You
The Lord said to Moses I have given you distinction above the people by speaking to you and giving you My Message
Receive what I have given to you and give Us thanks
We wrote advice and laws for him on Tablets about all kinds of things saying Follow them and command your people to follow the good advice therein and I will show you the dwellings of the evildoers
We will deprive those who are wrongly proud in the land of the blessing of revelations
Even if they would see all kinds of miracles they would not have faith or even to see the right path they would not follow it
They would follow the rebellious way if they were to find one in their ignorance they have called Our revelations mere lies
The deeds of those who have called Our revelations and belief in the Day of Judgment mere lies will be turned devoid of all virtue
Can they expect to receive a reward for their deeds other than that which is the result of their deeds
In Moses absence his people manufactured a hollow sounding calf out of their ornaments
Could they not see that it could not speak to them or provide them with any guidance
They gained only evil by worshipping the calf
When they found that they had believed in the wrong thing they regretfully said If our Lord will not have mercy on us and forgive us we will certainly be lost
When Moses returned to his people with anger and sorrow he said What you have done in my absence is certainly evil
Why were you hasty about the commandments of your Lord
He threw away the Tablets which contained the commandments of God grabbed his brother and started to pull him to himself
His brother begged him saying Son of my mother the people suppressed me and almost killed me
Do not humiliate me before the enemies or call me unjust
Moses prayed Lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy you are the most Merciful
The Lord said Those who worshipped the calf will be afflicted by the wrath of their Lord and disgraced in their worldly life
Thus We will recompense those who invent falsehood
To those who commit bad deeds but then repent and believe in God Your Lord will certainly be Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When Moses anger calmed down he collected the Tablets
On one of them was written God s mercy and guidance are for those who have fear of Him
Moses selected seventy men from his people to attend Our appointment
In Our presence
When an earthquake jolted them to death Moses said Lord had You wanted to destroy them why did You not destroy them and me before
Are You destroying us for what the fools among us have done
This destruction is only a trial through which You cause some to go astray and guide others
You are our Guardian
Forgive us and have mercy on us You are the best of those who forgive
Grant us wellbeing in this life and in the life hereafter for we have turned ourselves to You The Lord replied My torment only afflicts those whom I want to punish but My mercy encompasses all things I shall grant mercy to those who maintain piety pay their religious tax and those who have faith in Our revelations
There are those who follow the Messengers the illiterate Prophet not conventionally educated whose description they find written in the Torah and the Gospel
He the Messengers enjoins them to do good and forbids them to do all that is unlawful makes lawful for them all that is pure and unlawful all that is filthy removes their burdens and the entanglements in which they are involved
Those who believe in him honor and help him and follow the light which is sent down to him will have everlasting happiness
Muhammad tell them People I have come to you all as the Messengers of God to whom the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs
There is no God but He
In His hands are life and death
Have faith in God and His Messengers the unlettered Prophet who believes in God and His words Follow him so that you will perhaps have guidance
Among the people of Moses are some whose guidance and Judgment are based on the Truth
We divided the descendants of Israel into twelve tribes and told Moses to strike the rock with his staff to let twelve fountains gush out therefrom his people had asked him to supply them with water
The twelve flowing springs were divided among them a spring for each tribe and each tribe knew its drinking place well
We provided them with shade from the clouds sent down manna and quails to them for food and told them to eat the pure things which We had given them
They did not do injustice to Us but they wronged themselves
When they were told Settle down in this town eat as you wish seek forgiveness and enter the gate prostrating yourselves in obedience to the Lord and We will forgive you your sins and increase the reward of the righteous people
the unjust among them changed the words which they were told to say in the prayer
Therefore We sent upon them torment from the sky for their wrong deeds
Muhammad ask them about the people of the towns on the seashore
They had transgressed by catching fish on the Sabbath
Each Sabbath the fish came openly within their reach but not so on other days
Thus We were testing them because of their evil deeds
When a group of them questioned another group saying Why do you preach to those whom God has decided to destroy or punish by a severe torment they replied We preach to them for we are responsible in the sight of your Lord and so that perhaps they may have fear of God
When they the unjust people forgot what was preached to them We saved the preachers from evil and afflicted the unjust for their evil deeds with a dreadful torment
When they crossed the limit of the prohibition We made them turn into detested apes
Muhammad consider when your Lord declared to the Israelites His decision to raise a people above them who would make them suffer the worst kinds of torments until the Day of Judgment
Certainly your Lord s retribution is swift
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We divided them into nations on the earth some are righteous and others are not
We tested them with wellbeing and hardship so that they might return to the right path
Their descendants who inherited the Book gained by bribery only worthless things from the worldly life saying We shall be forgiven for what we have done
They would have even doubled such gains if they could have received more
Did they not make a covenant with God in the Book not to speak any thing other than the Truth about God and to study its contents well
The life hereafter is much better for the pious ones
Will you not then think
Those who devote themselves to the teachings of the Book and are steadfast in prayer should know that the reward of those who reform themselves will not be lost
When We raised the mount above them as a shadow and made it speak to them they thought that it would fall on them
We told them to devote themselves decisively to what was given to them and follow its guidance so that they would have fear of God
When your Lord asked all the offspring of Adam before their birth Am I not your Lord All of them testified and bore witness to their testimony that on the Day of Judgment they would not say We were not aware of this fact
or say Our fathers worshipped idols before us and we as their descendants followed them
Would you then destroy us because of what the followers of falsehood have done
Thus do We explain Our revelations so that they might return to the right path
Muhammad tell them the story of the person whom We inspired with Our guidance but who detached himself from it and who was then pursued by Satan until he turned into a rebel
Had We wanted We could have raised him to an exalted position but he clung to his earthly life and followed his own evil desires
Such person s bad habits are like those of a lazy dog in a warm climate who always has its tongue hanging out whether you chase it away or leave it alone
Such are the people who have called Our revelations mere lies
Muhammad tell them such stories so that perhaps they will think
How terrible is the example of those who have rejected Our revelations and have done injustice only to themselves
Those whom God has guided have the true guidance but those whom He has caused to go astray are certainly lost
We have destined many men and jinn for hell
They have hearts but do not understand eyes but do not see
They have ears but do not hear
They are worse than lost cattle
These are the heedless ones
God has the most blessed Names
You should address Him in your worship by these Names and keep away from those who pervert them
They will be recompensed for their evil deeds
Among Our creatures are a group who guide and judge with the Truth
We gradually lead those who have called Our revelations mere lies to destruction Their destruction will be such that they will not even notice how it seized them
Though I have given them a respite My plan against them is well established
Why will they not understand that their companion Muhammad is not possessed by jinn
Muhammad is only a Divinely authorized preacher
Have they not considered the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything that God has created Perhaps death approaches them
In what kind of guidance can they have faith besides that of the Quran
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray and has left to continue blindly in their rebellion
They ask you Muhammad When will the Day of Judgment be
Tell them My Lord knows best
It is He who has appointed its time
It will be a grave hour both in the heavens and the earth
It will only approach you suddenly
They say It seems that you know about the coming of the Day of Judgment
Tell them Only God knows about it and most people do not know
Muhammad say I have no control over my benefits or sufferings without the will of God
Had I known about the unseen I would have gained much good and would have faced no suffering
I am only a warner and I preach the glad news to the believing people
It is God Who created you from a single soul and out of it made its spouse to bring it comfort
When he man engaged in carnal relations with her she conceived a light burden which she had to carry
When the baby grew in her womb they husband and wife both prayed to their Lord If You grant us a healthy son we shall certainly give you thanks
When they were given a healthy son they began to love him as much as they loved God
God is too exalted to be loved equally to anything else
Do they the pagans consider things that do not create anything but are themselves created equal to God
The idols are things that are not able to help others or even themselves
Believers even if you invite them to true guidance they will not follow you
It makes no difference whether you invite them or whether you keep quiet
Those whom you pagans worship besides God are themselves servants just like yourselves If your claim was true they should answer your prayers
Do they the idols have feet to walk hands to hold things eyes to see and ears to hear
Muhammad tell them the pagans to call on their idols for help and to plan against Me without delay
The true Guardian is certainly God who has revealed the Book and is the Guardian of the righteous ones
The idols which you the pagans worship besides God can neither help you nor themselves
Muhammad if you invite them to the right guidance they will not listen to you
You will see them looking at you but they do not really see
Have forgiveness preach the truth and keep away from the ignorant ones
If Satan will try to seduce you seek refuge from God
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
When a satanic thought starts to bother the pious ones they understand and see the light
while their brethren ceaselessly try to drag them into error
If you Muhammad do not show them a miracle they will keep on insisting that you must show them one Say I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord
This Quran contains wisdom for you from your Lord
It contains guidance and mercy for those who have faith
Whenever the Quran is recited to you listen to it quietly so that you may receive mercy
Remember your Lord deep within yourselves humbly and privately instead of shouting out loud in prayer in the mornings and evenings and do not be of the heedless ones
Those who are near to your Lord do not disdain from worshipping Him
They glorify Him and prostrate themselves in obedience to Him
They the believers ask you Muhammad about the booty captured from the enemies during a war
Tell them It belongs to God and the Messengers
If you have faith have fear of God Settle the disputes among yourselves and obey God and His Messengers
When God is mentioned the true believers begin to feel fear of Him in their hearts and when His revelations are recited to them their faith strengthens In God alone do they trust
They are steadfast in prayer and spend part of what We have given them for the cause of God
Such are the true believers
Their reward from their Lord will be high ranks forgiveness and a generous provision
A group among the believers dislike God s decree about the booty captured in war as well as His command that you come out of your home for a truthful purpose to fight for justice
Knowing it well that a fight in which they are to take part is about to take place they act as though they are being driven to death which they can see before their very eyes Despite their knowledge of the truth they still argue with you
When God promised to grant you believers victory over either one of the two groups you wished to have control over the unarmed one
God decided to prove to you the truth of His promises and to destroy the unbelievers
so that the truth would stand supreme and falsehood would exist no more even though the criminals dislike it
When you believers begged for assistance from your Lord He said I am helping you with a thousand angels all in rows marching one after the other
God has sent this glad news to comfort your hearts
Victory is in the hands of God alone
God is Majestic and Allwise
The slumber that overcame you was from God that brought you peace He showered water from the sky over you to clean you remove satanic wickedness from you strengthen your hearts and grant you steadfastness
Your Lord inspired the angels saying I am with you
Encourage the believers
I shall cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers and you will strike their heads and limbs
they have opposed God and His Messengers
For those who oppose God and His Messengers God has prepared a severe retribution
We will say to them Endure the torment as a consequence of your evil deeds the unbelievers deserve nothing better than the torment of fire
Believers do not retreat when facing the marching army of the unbelievers for no believer will turn back at that time except for strategic reasons or to join another band
Whoever deserts the believers will incur the wrath of God and will dwell in hell a terrible dwelling
It was not you believers but God who slew the pagans
It was not you Muhammad but God who threw dust at them
He did this as a favorable test for the believers
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
This is how God causes the evil plans of the unbelievers to fail
If you the pagans are looking for conquest you certainly had a great chance at the battle of Badr
But if you were to give up such a desire it would be better for you
If you again wage war against Us We will be ready for such a confrontation
Your manpower will be of no help to you no matter how much you have God is with the believers
Believers obey God and His Messengers and do not turn away from Him when you hear His commands
Do not be like those who said that they have heard the Messenger s commands but do not pay any attention to them
The most wicked beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb who have no understanding
Had they possessed any virtue God would certainly have made them hear
Even if God were to make them hear they would still turn away from the words of God
Believers listen to God and the Messengers when they call you to that which gives you life
Know that God is between a man and his heart and that before Him you will all be brought together
Guard yourselves against discord among yourselves so that it will not mislead anyone of you especially the unjust and know that God s retribution is most severe
Recall the time when you the believers were only a few suppressed people in the land afraid of being terrorized by the people
God gave you shelter supported you with His help and bestowed on you pure provisions so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Believers do not be dishonest to God and the Messengers or knowingly abuse your trust
Know that your possessions and children are a temptation for you and that God has the greatest reward for the righteous ones
Believers if you fear God He will give you guidance will expiate your bad deeds and forgive you
God s favors are the greatest
The unbelievers planned to imprison murder or expel you Muhammad from your city
They make evil plans but God too plans and God s plans are the best
When Our revelations are recited to them the unbelievers they say We have heard them
Had we wanted we could also have composed such statements they are no more than ancient legends
They also say Lord if this Quran is the Truth from you shower down stones on us from the sky instead of rain or send us a painful punishment
God would not punish them while you were among them nor while they were asking for forgiveness
Why should God not punish them when they hinder people from entering the sacred mosque
They are not its true patrons Only the righteous ones are its patrons but most of the pagans do not know
Their unbelievers prayer at the mosque is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands
We shall tell them Suffer torment for your disbelief
The disbelievers spend their wealth to turn men away from the way of God
They will continue to spend but it will become a source of regret for them and they will be defeated because of their evil plans
The disbelievers will be gathered all togdher in Hell
God will separate the wicked from the pure and will pile the wicked ones on top of one anothcr to be cast into hell
They are indeed lost
Muhammad tell the unbelievers if you give up your evil behavior God will forgive whatever you have done in the past
But if you transgras again your fate will be the same as that of those unbelievers who lived before you
Fight them so that idolatry will not exist any more and God s religion will stand supreme
If theygive up the idols God will be Well Aware of what they do
If the unbelievers turn away from the faith God is you believers best Guardian and best Helper
Know that whatever property you may gain one fifth belongs to God the Messenger the kindred orphans the needy and those who need money while on a journey This is the law if you believe in God and what We revealed to Our Servant on the Day of Distinction Badr when the armies confronted each other
God has power over all things
Recall when your army was positioned at the less defensible brink of the valley the pagans army had the more defensible higher side of the valley and the caravan was led out of your reach below
This situation did not take place according to your previous plans otherwise everything would have been different
It was God s plan to place you in a vulnerable position exposed to the enemy and it was His plan to lead the caravan out of your reach so that His decree that you would be granted a victory by a miracle would become a doubtless fact and so that those who were to be destroyed would face destruction with a clear knowledge of the Truth and those who were to survive would also survive with a clear knowledge of the Truth
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
In your dream God showed the pagans army as being only a few in number for if He had showed them as a great number you would have lost courage and would have started to quarrel among yourselves concerning this matter
But God saved you from that condition He knows what is in your hearts
When you met the pagans army God made them appear fewer in your eyes and you appear fewer in their eyes so that His miracle of granting you an incredible victory could easily be fulfilled
To God do all things return
Believers stand firm when you meet a band of your enemy and remember God often so that you may have everlasting happiness
Obey God and His Messenger
Do not quarrel with each other lest you fail or lose honor
Exercise patience God is with those who have patience
Do not be like those who marched out boastfully to show off their strength to people and hinder people from the way of God
God encompasses everyone s activities
Satan made their pagans deeds seem attractive to them and said to them No one today is more powerful than you and I am your supporter
But when the two armies confronted one another and the pagans were defeated then satan betrayed his friends saying I am not with you any more I see what you do not see and I am afraid of God
God is severe in His retribution
The hypocrites and those whose hearts are sick say The believers religion has deceived them
Those who trust in God will find Him Majestic and Allwise
Would that you could have seen the angels taking the souls of the unbelievers away from their bodies and smiting their faces and their backs saying Suffer the burning torment
This is the result of their deeds
God is not unjust to His servants
The same thing happened to the people of Pharaoh and those who lived before them
They rejected the revelations of God and because of their sins His retribution struck them
God is Allpowerful and stern in His retribution
God does not change the favor that He has bestowed on a nation unless that nation changes what is in its soul
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Like the people of the Pharaoh and those who lived before them the unbelievers rejected the revelations of God
We destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh
They were all unjust
The most wicked creatures in the sight of God are the unbelievers who never have faith
who make promises but break them every time and who have no piety
When you capture the unbelievers during a fight teach them a lesson so that they thereafter will always be aware of the threat of your power
If you are afraid of the treachery of some of your allies you may disregard your treaty with them
God does not love the treacherous ones
The unbelievers should not think that they can really escape Us or that they can never be defeated
Mobilize your defensive force as much as you can to frighten the enemies of God and your own enemies This also will frighten those who are behind them whom you do not know but God knows well
Whatever you spend for the cause of God He will give you sufficient recompense with due justice
If they the unbelievers propose peace accept it and trust in God
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
If they want to deceive you God is Allsufficient for you
It is God who supported you with His own help and with that of the believers
among whose hearts He has placed affection and unity
If you were to spend the wealth of the whole earth you would not have been able to unite their hearts but God has been able to unite them God is Majestic and Allwise
Prophet God and the believers who follow you are sufficient support for you
Prophet mobilize the believers for the battle
It will take only twenty of your men who are steadfast in prayer to defeat two hundred unbelieving men
Your two hundred men would defeat their two thousand the unbelievers have no understanding
Now that God has eased your burden He has found you to be weak
A hundred of your steadfast men would defeat two hundred of theirs and a thousand of yours would defeat two thousand of the unbelievers by the will of God
God is with those who have patience
The Prophet is not supposed to take any captives to strengthen his position on the earth
You want worldly gains but God wants the life hereafter for you
God is Majestic and Allwise
Had you taken captives before being allowed by God s revelations a great torment would have struck you for what you had done
Use what you have acquired from the battle as your own good lawful property
Have fear of God He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Prophet tell the captives with you If God finds anything good in your hearts He will give you a better reward than that which was taken from you and will forgive you
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not be surprised that they want to be dishonest with you they have always been dishonest with God
However He has power over them
God is Allknowing and Allwise
The believers who left their homes and strove for the cause of God through their property and in person and those who gave refuge to them and helped them will be each other s guardians
The believers who did not leave their homes are not your guardians until they too leave their homes
If they ask you for help in a religious cause you must help them against their enemies unless their enemies have a peace treaty with you
God is Well Aware of what you do
The unbelievers are each other s friends
If you the believers do not keep the same among yourselves in the land there will come into being widespread idolatry and great evil
The believers who left their homes and strove for the cause of God and those who gave them refuge and helped them are true believers
They will have forgiveness from their Lord and will be granted honorable provisions
Those who accepted the faith later left their homes and strove with you for the cause of God are also your people
They relatives are nearer to each other according to the Book of God
God has knowledge of all things
God and His Messenger declare the abrogation of the peace treaty that existed between them and the pagans
However during the four sacred months they pagans may travel peacefully through the land
Know pagans that you cannot make God helpless but it is God who has the power to disgrace the unbelievers
This Announcement from God and His Messenger is to be made to the people on the day of the great Pilgrimage God and His Messenger have declared no amnesty for the pagans
If you pagans repent it would be better for you but if you turn away from God know that you cannot make God helpless
Muhammad tell the unbelievers that a painful punishment has been prepared for them
This does not apply to the pagans with whom you have a valid peace treaty and who have not broken it from their side or helped others against you
You believers must fulfill the terms of the peace treaty with them
God loves the pious ones
When the sacred months are over slay the pagans wherever you find them Capture besiege and ambush them
If they repent perform prayers and pay the religious tax set them free
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If any of the pagans ask you to give them refuge give them asylum so that they may hear the words of God
Then return them to their towns for they are an ignorant people
How can the pagans except those with whom you have established a peace treaty in the precinct of the Sacred Mosque have a covenant with God and His Messenger
If they respect the pact you too should also follow its terms
God loves the pious ones
How could God and His Messenger grant them pagans peace when if they were to acquire superiority over you they would respect none of the peace treaties nor their kindred relations with you
They only try to please you by paying lipservice to you but their hearts are against you and most of them are evildoers
They have sold God s revelations for a paltry price and have created obstacles in the way of God
What they have done is evil
They do not respect their promises nor their family ties with the believers
They are transgressors
If they repent perform their prayers pay religious tax they would be your brothers in the religion
We explain Our revelations to people of knowledge
Fight against the leaders of the unbelievers if they violate their established peace treaty with you and revile your faith to force them to stop their aggression against you
You do not have to bind yourselves to such a treaty
Why will you not fight against a people who have broken their peace treaty with you have decided to expel the Messenger from his home town and who were the first to disregard the peace treaty
If you are true believers you should only have fear of God
Fight them May God punish them by your hands humiliate them give you victory over them delight the hearts of the believers
and appease their anger
God forgives whomever He wants and He is Allknowing and Allwise
Do you think that God will not make any distinction between those of you who have fought for His cause and have relied on no one other than God His Messenger and the faithful ones and other people
God is Well Aware of what you do
The pagans do not have any right to establish and patronize the mosque of God while they testify against their souls to its disbelief
Their deeds are devoid of all virtue and they will live forever in hell fire
Only those who believe in God the Day of Judgment perform their prayers pay the religious tax and have fear of God alone have the right to establish and patronize the mosque of God so that perhaps they will have the right guidance
Do you pagans because you served water to the pilgrims and constructed the Sacred Mosque consider yourselves equal to those who have believed in God the Day of Judgment and have fought for the cause of God
In the sight of God you pagans are not equal to the believers
God does not guide the unjust
To those who have believed in God left their homes and fought for His cause with their possessions and in person God will grant high ranks and success
Their Lord will give the glad news of His granting mercy to them His pleasure and His admitting them to a Paradise full of everlasting bounties wherein they will live forever
The reward that God will bestow on His servants is the greatest
Believers do not accept your fathers and brothers as your guardians if they prefer disbelief to faith lest you be unjust
Muhammad tell them If your fathers children brothers spouses relatives the property that you possess the trade you fear may have no profit and the homely life are more beloved to you than God His Messenger and fighting for His cause wait until God fulfills His decree of making the right distinct from the wrong
God does not guide the evildoers
God has helped you on many occasions including the day of Hunayn name of a place near Mecca
When you were happy with the number of your men who proved to be of no help to you and the whole vast earth seemed to have no place to hide you from your enemies and you turned back in retreat
God gave confidence to His Messenger and the believers and helped them with an army which you could not see God punished the unbelievers this is the only recompense that the unbelievers deserve
After that occasion God forgave those whom He wanted
God is Allknowing and Allmerciful
Believers the pagans are filthy Do not let them come near to the Sacred Mosque after this year
If you are afraid of poverty He will make you rich if He wishes by His favor
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Fight against those People of the Book who have no faith in God or the Day of Judgment who do not consider unlawful what God and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not believe in the true religion until they humbly pay tax with their own hands
Some of the Jews have said that Ezra is the son of God and Christians have said the same of Jesus
This is only what they say and it is similar to what the unbelievers who lived before them had said
May God destroy them wherever they exist
They unconditionally obeyed the rabbis and the monks and worshipped the Messiah son of Mary as they should have obeyed God They were commanded to worship no one besides God who is the only God and who is too exalted to be considered equal to any idols
They would like to extinguish the light of God with a blow from their mouths but even though the unbelievers may dislike it God has decided to let His light shine forever
It is God Who sent His Messenger with guidance and a true religion that will prevail over all other religions even though the pagans may dislike it
Believers many rabbis and monks consume other people s property by false means and create obstacles in the way of God
Those who horde gold and silver and do not spend anything out of it for the cause of God should know that their recompense will be a painful torment
on the Day of Judgment and that their treasures will be heated by the fire of hell and pressed against their foreheads sides and back with this remark These are your own treasures which you hoarded for yourselves
See for yourselves what they feel like
According to the Book of God from the day He created the heavens and the earth the number of months are twelve four of which are sacred
This is part of the law of the religion
Do not commit injustice against your souls during the sacred months but fight all the pagans just as they fight against all of you Know that God is with the pious ones
To disregard the observation of the sacred months and to observe it during the nonsacred months is to add more to one s disbelief This causes the unbelievers to go further astray
One year they the pagans consider a sacred month not sacred and observe it during a nonsacred month but the next year they consider it sacred at the right time
By dealing with the sacred months in such a manner they think that they have observed the laws of God but in fact they have changed them
Their evil deeds seem attractive to them but God does not guide the unbelieving people
Believers why is it that when you are told to march for the cause of God you seem to linger at home
Have you given preference to the worldly life over the life hereafter
The worldly gains compared to those of the next life are but very little
If you do not march for His cause He will afflict your with a painful punishment and replace you by another nation and your destruction will not harm Him at all
God has power over all things
If you do not help him Muhammad God has already helped him
When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend Do not worry God is with us then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme
God is Majestic and Allwise
Whether unarmed or well equipped march and fight for the cause of God with your possessions and in person
This would be better for you if only you knew it
Had the gain been immediate or the journey shorter they hypocrites would certainly have followed you Muhammad but it was too far for them
They will swear by God Had we had the ability we would certainly have marched with you
They destroy only themselves and God knows that they are lying
May God forgive you
Muhammad why did you not let them join the army so that you could discern the liars from the truthful ones
Those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment do not ask you whether they should fight for the cause of God with their property and in person or not
God knows all about the pious ones
Only those who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment ask you such questions because their hearts are full of doubts and they cannot make any final decisions
Had they the hypocrites wanted to join your army they would have prepared themselves but God did not wish to motivate them so He caused them to linger behind with those whose joining you in battle would be of no use
Had they joined you they would have been of no help to you but would have just caused confusion and trouble among you by sneaking through the ranks where some of you would be ready to listen to them
God knows best the unjust
Even prior to this they tried to cause trouble and to turn your affairs upsidedown until the truth came and the cause of God triumphed against their desires
Some of them ask you Make us exempt from taking part in the battle and do not try to tempt us by telling us what we may gain from the battle many people have died in the battle
Hell certainly encompasses the unbelievers
If you gain success it grieves them but if you suffer hardship they turn away from you saying It s good that we took our affairs into our own hands
Muhammad say Nothing will happen to us besides what God has decreed for us
He is our Guardian
In God alone do the believers trust
For us you can anticipate nothing other than Paradise if we are killed or success if we triumph However what we can anticipate for you is either punishment by the hands of God or by ours
Wait and we too are waiting with you
Say Whether you spend your wealth for the cause of God willingly or reluctantly it will never be accepted from you you are an evil doing people
What prevents their offerings from being accepted is their disbelief in God and His Messenger their lack of interest in prayer and spending for the cause of God reluctantly
Let not their property and children tempt you God wants to punish them through their things in this life so that their souls will depart while they are unbelievers
They swear by God that they are believers like you but they are not believers
They are a people who only cause differences
They are so afraid of you that had there been a place for them to seek refuge a cave or some entrance in which to hide themselves from you they would have madly rushed therein
They blame you about the distribution of the welfare funds
They are pleased when you give them something from it but if they receive nothing they become angry with you
Would that they had been pleased with what God and His Messenger had given them and had said God is AllSufficient for us
God and His Messenger will soon do us more favors and we have hope in God s mercy
Welfare funds zakat are only for the poor the destitute the tax collectors those whose hearts are inclined towards Islam the slaves those who cannot pay their debts for the cause of God and for those who have become needy on a journey Paying zakat is an obligation that God has decreed
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Some of them speak ill of the Prophet saying He listens to everything and believes what he hears
Muhammad tell them He only listens to what is good for you believes in God and has trust in the believers
He is a mercy for the believers among you
Those who speak ill of the Messenger of God will face a painful punishment
They hypocrites swear by God in their effort to please you but if they were true believers they would know that God and His Messenger deserve more to be pleased than anyone else
Do they not know that for displeasing God and His Messenger one would be admitted to Hell wherein he would live forever
This indeed is a great humiliation
The hypocrites are afraid that some revelation will be revealed thus making public what is in their hearts
Muhammad tell them Continue in your mockery God will certainly let whatever causes you worry to take place
If you question them about their manners they say We were only arguing for the sake of amusement
Ask them Were you mocking God His revelations and His Messenger
Make no excuses
You have certainly turned back to disbelief
If We forgive one group of you We must punish the other for they are guilty
Be they male or female hypocrites they are the same
They make others commit sins prevent them from doing good deeds and restrain their hands from spending for the cause of God
They have forgotten all about God who also has ignored them
The hypocrites indeed are evildoers
For the hypocrites and the unbelievers God has prepared hell wherein they will live forever
Hell is their proper punishment
God has condemned them and they will suffer a permanent torment
like that of those who lived before you whose power wealth and children were much greater than yours
They enjoyed their share of the worldly gains and you also like them have enjoyed yours
You have been sneaking among the people to cause trouble just as they had been doing before you
Such people s deeds are devoid of all virtue both in this life and in the life hereafter
They indeed are lost
Have they not heard the stories of the people of Noah the tribe of Ad Thamud the people of Abraham the dwellers of the city of Midian and those of the Subverted Cities
God s Messengers came to each of them with miracles
God did not do any injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The believers both male and female are each other s guardians
They try to make others do good prevent them from committing sins perform their prayers pay the religious tax and obey God and His Messenger
God will have mercy on them He is Majestic and Allwise
God has promised the believers gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever in the excellent mansions of the garden of Eden
What is more important than all this for them is that God is pleased with them
Such is the supreme triumph
Prophet fight the unbelievers and hypocrites vehemently for the cause of God Their dwelling is hell a terrible destination
They the hypocrites swear by the Name of God to make others believe in what they are saying
They have spoken the testimony of disbelief and have then turned back to disbelief They have made unsuccessful attempts to cause trouble
There is no other reason for their ungratefulness except that God and His Messenger enriched them through their favors
If they repent it will be better for them but if they turn away from the faith God will make them suffer a painful punishment both in this life and in the life hereafter
They will find no guardian nor any helper in the land
Some of them have promised God that if He will favor them they will certainly spend for His cause and be righteous ones
But when His favors were bestowed on them they became niggardly and in disregard broke their promise
God will for their disregard of their promise and their telling lies place hypocrisy in their hearts which will not leave them until they face the consequences of their deeds
Were they not aware that God knows all that they hide or whisper and that He has absolute knowledge of the unseen
God mocks those hypocrites who blame and mock the rich or poor believers who donate to the welfare funds and He has prepared a painful torment for them
Muhammad whether you ask God to forgive them or not He will never do so even if you were to beg seventy times they have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and God does not guide the evildoers
Those who did not take part in the battle of Tabuk were glad about their staying home against the order of the Messenger of God They did not want to fight for the cause of God with their property and in person and said Do not march to the battle on the hot days
Muhammad tell them The heat of hell fire is much more severe if only you would understand
They should laugh less and weep more as a recompense for what they have gained
When God brings you back safely and a group of hypocrites ask you to make them exempt from taking part in the battle tell them Never march with me and never fight with us against any of the enemies of God
You chose to linger behind the first time so this time stay behind with those who are of no help in the battle
Should any of them die never pray for him or stand on his grave
They have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and have died while committing evil
Their wealth or children should not tempt you God wants to punish them through these things in this life so that they will die as disbelievers
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed telling them to believe in God and fight along with His Messenger for His cause against His enemies the healthy and rich ones of them ask you to exempt them from taking part in the battle for the cause of God and to let them stay home with the people who are of no help in the battle
They are happy to stay home with those who are of no help in the battle thus their hearts were sealed and they were left with no understanding
But the Messenger of God and the believers with him fought for the cause of God with their possessions and in person and their reward will be all good things and everlasting happiness
God has established gardens for them wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
This indeed is the greatest triumph
Some of the dwellers of the desert who were not able to join the army came to the Prophet seeking exemption from taking part in the battle
Those who called God and His Messengers liars also stayed home with those who were truly exempt
The disbelievers will soon receive a painful punishment
People who are weak or sick and those who do not have the means to take part in the fighting are exempt from this duty if their intention remains sincere about God and His Messenger
Righteous people shall not be blamed
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who come to you Muhammad asking to be taken to the battle but you cannot find the necessary means for them are exempt from the duty of fighting for the cause of God even though they leave you with their eyes flooded with tears because of not being able to help the cause of God
The blameworthy ones are those who ask for exemption despite their ability and who preferred to stay at home with those who are truly exempt
God has placed a seal on their hearts but they do not know
They will apologize to you on your return
Tell them Do not ask for pardon We will never believe you
God has already told us everything about you
God and His Messenger will soon make your deeds public then you will return to Him who has absolute knowledge of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of what you have done
When you return they will appeal to you in the Name of God to leave them alone
So leave them alone
They are filthy and their dwelling will be hell as a recompense for what they had gained
They swear in the Name of God to please you
Even if you were to be pleased with them God is not pleased with evildoing people
The desert dwelling Arabs are far worse than the others in their disbelief and hypocrisy and have more reason to be ignorant of the revelations that God revealed to His Messenger
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Whatever some of the desert dwelling Arabs spend for the cause of God they consider it a loss to themselves
They wish to see you in trouble Trouble has struck them already
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Some of the desert dwelling Arabs believe in God and the Day of Judgment Whatever they spend for the cause of God they consider it as a means of getting nearer to God and have the prayers of the Messenger in their favor
This certainly is a means to get nearer to God
God will admit them into His mercy
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God is well pleased with the foremost ones of those who left their homes for the cause of God those who helped them after their arrival in Medina and those who nobly followed these two groups
He has prepared gardens for them wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
This certainly is the supreme triumph
Some of the desert dwelling Arabs around you are hypocrites as are some of the inhabitants of Medina
They are persisting in their hypocrisies
You do not know them but We know them well and will punish them twice over
Then they will be brought to the great torment on the Day of Judgment
Some of them have already confessed their sins and have mixed virtuous deeds with sinful ones
Perhaps God will forgive them
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Collect religious tax zakat from them to purify and cleanse them and pray for them your prayers give them comfort God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Do they not know that it is God who accepts the repentance of His servants and receives the welfare funds and that it is God who is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad tell them Act as you wish
God His Messenger and the believers will see your deeds
You will be brought before the One who has absolute knowledge of the unseen and the seen He will let you know about all that you have done
Besides those who have confessed their sins there are others who have no good deeds for which they may receive any reward or sins for which they may be punished
Their fate will be in the hands of God
God is Allknowing and Allwise
The mosque which some of the hypocrites have established is only to harm people to spread disbelief to create discord among the believers to wait for the one who fought against God and His Messenger and to make others believe that it has been established with their good intentions But God testifies that they are liars
Muhammad never stay in that mosque
The mosque which was established for a pious purpose and before all other mosques is more virtuous for your prayer
In this mosque there are people who love to be purified God loves those who purify themselves
Which is better the mosque that is founded for pious purposes and for achieving God s pleasure or that which is based on the brink of a crumbling bank and which may crumble into hell at any moment
God does not guide the unjust
The building mosque which they have built always motivates mischief in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces
God is Allknowing and Allwise
God has purchased the souls and property of the believers in exchange for Paradise They fight for the cause of God to destroy His enemies and to sacrifice themselves
This is a true promise which He has revealed in the Torah the Gospel and the Quran
No one is more true to His promise than God
Let this bargain be glad news for them This is indeed the supreme triumph
The believers who repent for their sins worship God praise Him travel through the land for pious purposes kneel down and prostrate themselves in obedience to God make others do good and prevent them from sins and abide by the laws of God will receive a great reward
Let this be glad news for the believer
After it was made clear that the pagans are to be the dwellers of hell the Prophet and the believers should not have sought forgiveness from God for them even though they may have been relatives
There was no other reason for Abraham to seek forgiveness from God for his father except the promise that he had made with him
When Abraham knew that his father was an enemy of God he disowned his father
Abraham was very tenderhearted and forbearing
God does not misguide a nation after having given them guidance until the means of piety are made known to them
God knows all things
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He grants life and causes death
God is your only Guardian and Helper
God pardoned the Prophet the Emigrants the Helpers and those who followed them when the hearts of some of them almost deviated from the truth in their hour of difficulty
God forgave them because of His Compassion and Mercy
God also forgave the three people who lagged behind
Grief made them feel as though there was no place in the whole vast earth to hide them or in their souls to conceal their sorrow
They began to believe that no one could save them from the wrath of God except He Himself
God pardoned them so that they would also repent for their sins God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers have fear of God and always be friends with the truthful ones
The inhabitants of the city of Medina and the desert Arabs dwelling around it were not supposed to disobey the Messenger of God or to give priority to their own lives above that of the Prophet For if they had given priority to the life of the Messenger of God they would not have experienced the hardships of thirst fatigue or hunger in their struggle for the cause of God nor would their travelling have enraged the disbelievers and they would not have received any injury from enemies that God would not record for them as a virtuous deed
God does not ignore the reward of those who do good
Also they would not have spent anything great or small for the cause of God or travel through a valley without God decreeing a reward for them far better than whatever they had done
Not all believers have to become specialists in religious learning
Why do not some people from each group of believers seek to become specialists in religious learning and after completing their studies guide their group so that they will have fear of God
Believers fight the unbelievers near you for the cause of God so that they realize your strength and know that God is with the pious ones
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed some people ask others Whose faith among you people has received strength from this revelation
It the revelation certainly strengthens the faith of the believers and they consider it to be a glad news
But to those whose hearts are sick it adds more filth to their hearts and they die as disbelievers
Do they not realize that God tests them once or twice a year but nevertheless they do not repent and give it proper thought
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed it upsets them They look at one another and their eyes silently ask this question Has any one noticed the disappointment on our faces
Then they walk away In fact God has turned their hearts away from the truth they are a people who have no understanding
A Messenger from your own people has come to you
Your destruction and suffering is extremely grievous to him He really cares about you and is very compassionate and merciful to the believers
Muhammad if they turn away from you say God is Sufficient support for me
There is no God but He
In Him do I trust and He is the Owner of the Great Throne
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book of wisdom
Why should it seem strange to mankind that We sent revelations to a mortal among them who would warn others and give to the believers the glad news of their high rank in the sight of God The unbelievers have said He Muhammad is certainly a magician
God is your Lord who has created the heavens and the earth in six days and established His Dominion over the Throne He maintains order over the creation
No one can intercede for others without His permission
It is God who is your only Lord
Worship only Him
Will you then not think
People you will all return to God
The promise of God is true He creates all things and after their death brings them to life again so that He may justly reward the righteously striving believers
The disbelievers will drink boiling filthy water and suffer painful torment as a recompense for their disbelief
It is God who has made the sun radiant and the moon luminous and has appointed for the moon certain phases so that you may compute the number of years and other reckonings
God has created them for a genuine purpose
He explains the evidence of His existence to the people of knowledge
The alternation of the day and night and all that God has created in the heavens and earth are evidence of the existence of God for the pious people
Those who do not have hope of receiving Our mercy in the life hereafter who are pleased and satisfied with the worldly life and who pay no attention to Our revelations
will all have the Fire as their dwelling for that which they had done
The righteously striving believers receive through their faith guidance from their Lord to the bountiful gardens wherein streams flow
Their prayer shall be Glory be to you Lord and their greeting Peace be with you and the only other words of worldly speech they will speak will be It is God Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Had God been as hasty to punish people as they were hasty to achieve good their life would have already ended
We will leave those who have no hope of receiving Our mercy in the life hereafter to continue blindly in their transgression
When the human being is affected by hardship he starts to pray while lying on his side sitting or standing but when We relieve him from hardship he starts to act as though he had never prayed to Us to save him from the misfortune
This is how transgressors deeds are made attractive to them
We destroyed certain generations who lived before you because of their injustice Our Messengers came to them and showed them miracles but they would not believe
Thus do We punish the criminals
We have made you their successors in the land so that We could see how you behaved
Whenever Our authoritative revelations are recited to those who do not wish to meet Us in the life hereafter say Bring us another book besides this one or change it
Muhammad tell them I can not change it myself
I only follow what is revealed to me
I fear that for disobeying my Lord I shall be punished on the great Day of Judgment
Muhammad tell them Had God wanted I would not have recited it the Book to you nor would I have told you anything about it
I lived among you for a whole lifetime before it was revealed
Will you then not understand
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or calls His revelations lies
The criminals will certainly have no happiness
Some people worship things other than God which harm nor benefit them They say These idols are our intercessors before God
Muhammad tell them Are you trying to tell God about something that He does not find in the heavens or earth
God is too Glorious to be considered equal to idols
All people once followed one belief
Then they began to follow different beliefs
Had not a word of your Lord His decision to give every one time and free will been decreed God would already have settled their differences
They unbelievers say Why has his Lord not given him some miracles to support his claim of being His Messenger
Say The knowledge of the unseen certainly belongs to God
Wait and I too shall be waiting with you
When people are granted mercy after having suffered hardship they begin to plot against Our revelations
Say God is the most swift in His plans
Our angelic messengers record all that you plot
When you are rejoicing in a boat a favorable breeze and a violent storm arises with waves surrounding you from all sides
Thinking that you will not survive you start to pray sincerely to God In prayer you say If You rescue us from this we shall certainly be grateful
When We saved you you started to rebel unjustly in the land
People your rebellion will only harm yourselves
You may enjoy the worldly life but to Us you will all return and We will let you know all that you had done
The example of the worldly life is like the water sent down from the sky which becomes mixed with the earth s produce that people and cattle consume
When the land becomes fertile and pleasant people think that they have control over it At Our command during the night or day the land becomes as barren as if it had no richness the day before
Thus do We explain the evidence of the truth for the people who reflect
God invites every one to the House of Peace and guides whomever He wants to the right path
The righteous will receive good reward for their deeds and more
Their faces will suffer no disgrace or ignominy
They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
The recompense for the evil deeds will be equally evil not more and the faces of the evildoers will suffer from disgrace
No one can protect them from the wrath of God
Their faces will become dark as if covered by the pitchdarkness of night
They will be the dwellers of hell wherein they will remain forever
We will tell the pagans on the day when every one is resurrected Stand with your idols wherever you are Then We will separate them from their idols and their idols will protest against them saying You did not worship us
God is Sufficient Witness for us that we were not aware of your worship
There every soul will experience the result of all that it had done They will be brought into the presence of God their true Lord and all that they falsely invented will vanish
Muhammad ask them Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and earth who truly possesses your hearing and seeing abilities who brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living and who regulates the whole Universe They will reply God Ask them Why then do you not have fear of Him
Thus is God your true Lord
In the absence of truth there is nothing but falsehood
Then where are you turning
The decree of your Lord that the evildoers will not have faith has already been issued
Muhammad ask them Can any of your idols create something cause it to die and then bring it back to life again
Say Only God can originate the creation and bring it to life again
Where have you strayed
Muhammad ask them Can any of your idols guide you to the Truth
Say Only God guides to the Truth
Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find guidance unless he is guided by others
What is wrong with you that you judge so unjustly
Most of the unbelievers follow only conjecture which certainly cannot serve as a substitute for the Truth
God knows well what they do
No one could have composed this Quran besides God
This confirms the existing Book the Bible and explains itself
There is no doubt that it is from the Lord of the Universe
Do they say that Muhammad has invented it
Muhammad tell them If your claim is true compose only one chapter like it and call on anyone besides God for help
They call a lie something that is beyond the limit of their knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet been revealed
Some people who lived before them also called Our revelations lies
Consider how terrible was the end of the unjust people
Some of them believe in the Quran and others do not
Your Lord knows best the evil doers
If they call you a liar tell them Let each one of us follow his own way
You will not be responsible for what I do and I will not be responsible for what you do
Some of them will listen to you but are you supposed to make the deaf hear even if they have no understanding
Some of them will look at you but are you supposed to guide the blind even if they have no vision
God does not do the least bit of injustice to anyone but people wrong themselves
On the day when they will be resurrected their worldly life will seem to them only as an hour of a day and they all will recognize each other
Those who called the receiving of mercy from God a lie are certainly lost
They did not have the right guidance
When if We show you them suffering Our retribution or you die before their suffering they will not be able to escape Our punishment they will all return to Us
God bears witness to whatever they do
A Messenger is appointed for all people
When the Messenger for them came he judged among them fairly and they were not wronged
They ask If you believers speak the truth when will your promise about the Day of Judgment be fulfilled
Muhammad tell them I have no control over my suffering or benefits unless God wills
Every nation is destined to live for an appointed time
They can neither delay that time nor can they cause it to come sooner
Ask them What benefit can criminals get from their demand that God must punish them immediately if His words are true
Whether His punishment befalls them during the day or night they will not be able to escape
Besides if He was to send them the punishment which they want to quickly experience would they then have faith
The unjust will be told Suffer the everlasting torment
Do you expect a recompense other than what you deserve
They ask you Is that punishment true Tell them It certainly is
I swear by my Lord
You can not escape from God s retribution
On the Day of Judgment to redeem oneself of one s injustice one would gladly spend the wealth of the whole earth if it were possible
On seeing the torment one will try to hide his regret
They will all be judged fairly and no wrong will be done to them
All that is in the heavens and the earth certainly belongs to God and His promise is true but many people do not know this
It is God who gives life and causes things to die
To Him you will all return
People good advice has come to you from your Lord a spiritual cure a guide and a mercy for the believers
Muhammad tell them To be happy with the favors and mercy of God is better than whatever you accumulate
Ask them Have you considered that out of the sustenance which God has given you you made some of it lawful and some unlawful
Did God permit you to do this or are you ascribing falsehood to Him
What do those who ascribe falsehood to God think of the Day of Judgment
God is generous to the human being yet many do not give thanks
Muhammad We bear witness to all your affairs whatever you recite from the Quran and whatever you people do
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from your Lord even that which is as small as an atom s weight or greater or smaller All is recorded in the glorious Book
The friends of God will certainly have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
Those who have faith and fear God
will receive glad news both in this life and in the life hereafter
The words of God do not change
This alone is the supreme triumph
Muhammad let not their words disappoint you all dignity belongs to God
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Does not all that is in the heavens and the earth belong to God
The unbelievers who worship the idols instead of God follow only conjecture
What they preach are mere lies
It is God who has made the night for you to rest and has filled the day with light as a means of visibility
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people who hear
Some people have said that God has begotten a son
God is too Glorious to have a son
God is Selfsufficient and to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
In this you people have no authority
Do you ascribe to God things of which you have no knowledge
Muhammad tell them Those who invent falsehood against God will have no happiness
They may consider it a means of enjoyment in this life but on the Day of Judgment they will all return to Us Then they will suffer for their disbelief the most severe punishment
Muhammad tell them the story of Noah who told his people Even if my belief and my preaching of the revelation of God seem strange to you I put my trust in Him
Unite yourselves and seek help from your idols
You should not regret what you want to do but should execute your plans against me without delay
If you turn away from my preaching it will not harm me I shall receive my reward from God who has commanded me to become a Muslim
They rejected Noah
Then We saved him and his people in the Ark to make them the successors of the rest
The others who had called Our revelations lies were drowned
Consider the fate of those who rejected Our warnings
After Noah We sent other Messengers to their people with clear authoritative evidence proving their prophetic claims
But how could the people believe what they had previously called lies
Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors
Then We sent Moses and Aaron with Our miracles to the Pharaoh and his people
These people also proved to be arrogant They were wicked people
When the Truth from Us came they called it simply magic
Moses asked Why do you call the Truth which has come to you magic
Magicians certainly will not have happiness
They asked Moses Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our fathers and to make yourselves the rulers in the land
We shall never accept your faith
The Pharaoh ordered every skillful magician to come into his presence
When all the magicians were brought to his court Moses asked them to cast down what they wanted to
When the magicians had thrown theirs Moses said What you have performed is magic
God will certainly prove it to be false He will not make the deeds of the corrupt people righteous
God will make the Truth stand supreme by His words even though the wicked people dislike it
No one believed in Moses except some young people of his own tribe who were at the same time very afraid of the persecution of the Pharaoh and his people
The Pharaoh was certainly a tyrant and a transgressor
Moses told his people If you have submitted yourselves to God and have faith in Him put your trust in Him
They said In God do we trust
Lord do not subject us to the persecution of the unjust ones
Lord save us through Your mercy from the disbelieving people
We sent a revelation to Moses and his brother to build houses for their people in the Pharaoh s town and to build them facing one another We told him that therein they should pray and that Moses should give the glad news of God s mercy to the faithful ones
Moses said Lord You have given the Pharaoh and his people great riches and splendor in this life and this makes them stray from Your path Lord destroy their wealth and harden their hearts in disbelief so that they will suffer the most painful torment
The Lord replied Moses the prayer of your brother and yourself has been heard
Both of you must be steadfast in your faith and must not follow the ignorant ones
We helped the children of Israel cross the sea safely
The Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel with wickedness and hate until the Pharaoh was drowned
As he was drowning the Pharaoh said I declare that there is no God but the One in whom the children of Israel believe and I have submitted to the Word of God
God replied Now you declare belief in Me but before this you were a disobedient rebel
We will save your body on this day so that you may become evidence of Our existence for the coming generations many people are unaware of such evidence
We settled the children of Israel in a blessed land and provided them with pure sustenance
They did not create differences among themselves until after the knowledge had come to them
God will judge their differences on the Day of Judgment
If you people have any doubt about what We have revealed to you about the Day of Judgment and other matters of belief ask those who read the Book that was revealed to the Prophets who lived before you
The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord
Thus do not doubt it in your heart
nor be of those who have called God s revelations lies lest you become lost
Even though all kinds of miracles will be shown to them those about whom the word of your Lord has been ordained will not have faith
until they face the most painful torment
Why did no one except the people of Jonah believe in their punishment before their death so that they could have benefitted from their faith
When the people of Jonah believed We saved them from a disgraceful torment in this life and provided them with the means of enjoyment for an appointed time
Had your Lord wished the whole of mankind would have believed in Him
Muhammad do you force people to have faith
No one can have faith without the permission of God
God will cast down filth on those who have no understanding
Muhammad tell them to consider that which is in the heavens and the earth
Evidence and warnings are of no avail to the disbelieving people
What can they expect other than the kind of punishment that befell the disbelieving people who had gone before them
Muhammad tell them Wait and I too will be waiting with you
We saved Our Messengers and those who believed We must save the believers
Muhammad say People if you have doubt about my religion know that I certainly do not worship the idols which you worship instead of God but I worship God who causes you to die I am commanded to believe in His existence
to have firm belief in the upright religion and not to be an idolater
nor to seek help from anyone other than God who can neither benefit nor harm me lest I become of the unjust
Muhammad if God afflicts you with hardship no one besides Him can save you
If God grants you a favor no one can prevent you from receiving His favors
God bestows His favors upon whichever of His servants He wants
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad say People truth has certainly come to you from your Lord
One who seeks guidance does so for his own good and One who goes astray will find himself lost
I am not your keeper
Muhammad follow what is revealed to you and have patience until God issues His Judgment He is the best Judge
Alif Lam
This is a Book from One who is Allwise and Allaware Its verses are well composed and distinctly arranged from one another
It teaches People do not worship anyone besides God
I Muhammad am His Messenger sent to warn you and to give you the glad news
Seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance for your sins
He will provide you good sustenance for an appointed time and will reward everyone according to his merits
I am afraid that you will suffer torment on the great Day of Judgment if you turn away from God
To God you will all return
God has power over all things
The unbelievers cover their breasts to try to hide their disbelief from God
But He knows very well whatever they conceal or reveal even when they cover themselves with their garments
God certainly knows the innermost secrets of the hearts
There is no living creature on earth that does not receive sustenance from God He knows its dwelling and resting place
Everything is recorded in the glorious Book
God created the heavens and the earth in six days His Throne existed on water so that He could test you and find out those among you who do good deeds
Muhammad if you were to tell them that after death they would be brought back to life again the unbelievers would say This is nothing but obvious magic
If We delay in afflicting them with Our punishment for an appointed time they ask What is preventing it the punishment from taking place
On the day when it punishment befalls them no one will be able to escape from it and that which they have mocked will surround them from all sides
We grant a favor to the human being and then take it away from him He becomes despairing and ungrateful
If after his hardship We grant him a blessing he grows proud and rejoicing and says All my hardships have gone
But those who exercise patience and do good works do not behave as such
They will receive forgiveness and a great reward from the Lord
Perhaps you Muhammad may by chance leave untold a part of that which is revealed to you and feel grieved because they say Why has some treasure not been sent to him or an angel sent down with him
Say I have come only to warn you
God is the Guardian of all things
Do they the unbelievers say that Muhammad has falsely ascribed the Quran to God
Ask them Compose ten chapters like those of the Quran and call on whomever you can for help besides God if you are true in your claim
If they will not respond to you know that God has sent it with His knowledge and that He is the only God
Will you then become Muslims
Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss
Such people will receive nothing in the next life except Hell fire
Their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and their efforts will be in vain
Should they be compared with those whose Lord has given them a guidance which is testified by a witness from among their own people and by the Book of Moses a guide and a mercy
Such people do believe in this guidance in the Quran
Those who disbelieve in the Quran will have hell as their dwelling place
Thus Muhammad have no doubt about it the Quran
It is certainly the truth from your Lord yet many people do not have faith
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God
When such people are brought into the presence of their Lord the witness will say These are the ones who told lies about their Lord
Certainly God will condemn the unjust
who prevent others from the way of God seek to make it appear crooked and who have no faith in the life hereafter
Such people will never weaken God s power on earth nor will they find any guardian besides God
Their punishment will be doubled and they will not be able to hear or see
They have lost their souls and their false deities will turn away from them
In the life to come they will certainly lose a great deal
The righteously striving believers who are humble before their Lord will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
Can the two groups the blind and the deaf be considered equal to those who have vision and hearing
Will you then not take heed
We sent Noah to his people to give them the clear warning
that they should not worship anyone besides God
Noah warned them I am afraid that you will suffer the most painful torment
The disbelievers among his people said We do not believe that you are any better than the rest of us we see that only the worthless hasty ones the lowliest among us follow you
Thus we do not think that you are superior to us rather you are all liars
Noah replied My people do you think that if my Lord has sent me a miracle and granted me mercy but your ignorance has obscured them from your sight we can force you to believe when you do not want to
My people I do not ask any payment for what I preach to you
No one except God has to give me any reward
I do not drive away those who have faith in my teaching they will all receive mercy from their Lord
I know that you are ignorant people
My people who would protect me against God if I were to drive these people away
Will you then not take heed
I do not say that God s treasures belong to me that I know the unseen or that I am an angel
Nor do I say about those whom you disdain that God will not give them any reward
God knows best what is in their hearts for then I would be unjust
They said Noah you have argued with us a great deal
Bring down on us whatever torment with which you have been threatening us if what you say is true
Noah replied God will bring torment down on you whenever He wants and you will not be able to make His plans fail
My advice will be of no benefit to you if God wants to let you go astray
He is your Lord and to Him you will all return
Do they say that Muhammad has falsely ascribed the Quran to God
Muhammad tell them Had I falsely ascribed it to God I shall be responsible for my own sins
I am certainly not responsible for whatever sins you commit
It was revealed to Noah that besides those who had already accepted his faith no one from his people would ever believe him
He was told not to be disappointed about what his people had done
but to build the Ark under the supervision and guidance of his Lord He was also told not to address any words to Him concerning the unjust for they were all to be drowned
Noah started to build the Ark but whenever some of his people passed by they would mock him
He in return would reply Mock us but just as you mock us we too will mock you
You will soon learn who will face a humiliating punishment and will be encompassed by an everlasting torment
When at last Our decree was fulfilled water gushed forth from the Oven in Noah s house We told him to carry in the Ark a pair male and female from every species his family except those who were destined to perish and the believers
No one believed in him except a few
Noah said Embark in it
It will sail in the name of God in His Name it will sail and in His Name it will cast anchor
My Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When the Ark sailed on with them amid the mountainous waves Noah called out to his son who kept away from them My son embark with us
Do not stay with the unbelievers
His son replied I shall climb up a mountain and this will save me from the flood
Noah said No one can escape on this day from God s command except those on whom He has mercy
The waves separated Noah from his son who was then drowned with the rest of the unbelievers
Then the earth was told to swallowup its water and the sky was ordered to stop raining
The water abated and God s command had been fulfilled
The Ark came to rest on Mount Judi
A voice said The unjust people are far away from the mercy of God
Noah prayed to his Lord saying Lord my son is a member of my family
Your promise is always true and you are the best Judge
His Lord replied He is not one of your family
He is a man of unrighteous deeds
Do not ask me about that which you have no knowledge
I advise you not to become an ignorant person
Noah said Lord I ask You to prevent me from asking You ignorant questions and beg you for pardon and mercy or else I shall certainly be lost
Noah was told Get down from the Ark
Your Lord s peace and blessings are upon you and your followers
Your Lord will grant favors to other nations and then afflict them with a painful torment
That which We have revealed to you Muhammad is news of the unseen
This was not known to you and to your people
Have patience
The pious will triumph in the end
To the tribe of Ad We sent their brother Hud who told them Worship God He is your only Lord The idols that you worship are plainly false
My people I do not ask any reward for what I have preached to you
No one can give me my reward except my Creator
Will you then not take heed
My people seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance
He will send you abundant rain from the sky and will increase your power
Do not sinfully turn away from Him
They said Hud you have not shown us any miracles
We shall not give up our idols because of what you say and we shall not have any faith in you
We believe that some of our gods have afflicted you with evil
Hud said God is my witness and so are you that I have no association
with the idols that you worship besides God
So plan against me without delay
I trust God who is my Lord as well as yours It is God who controls the destiny of all living creatures It is my Lord who knows the right path
If you turn away from Him since I have already preached to you the message that I carry He will replace you with another nation
You cannot harm Him the least
My Lord is the Protector of all things
When Our decree of destroying them was fulfilled We mercifully saved Hud and his believing followers We saved them from the intense torment
It was the tribe of Ad who denied the miracles of their Lord disobeyed His Messenger and followed the orders of every transgressing tyrant
They were condemned in this life and will be condemned in the life hereafter
The tribe of Ad had certainly rejected their Lord
God kept the tribe of Ad the people of Hud away from His mercy
To Thamud We sent their brother Salih who told them My people worship God He is your only Lord
It is He who has created you from the earth and has settled you therein
Seek forgiveness from Him and turn to Him in repentance
My Lord is certainly close to everyone and He hears all prayers
They said Salih we had great hope in you before this
Do you forbid us to worship that which our fathers had worshipped
We are doubtful and uncertain about what you have told us to worship
He said My people think
I have received authoritative evidence and mercy from my Lord so who will protect me from God if I disobey Him
You certainly want to destroy me
My people this is the shecamel of God a miracle to support the truth which has been brought to you
Leave her to graze in the land of God Do not harm her with your evil deeds lest torment will suddenly strike you
When they slew the shecamel Salih told them You have only three days to enjoy living in your homes before you will be struck by the torment
This is an inevitable prophecy
When Our decree came to pass We mercifully saved Salih and his faithful followers from that day s ignominy
Your Lord is certainly Mighty and Majestic
A blast struck the unjust and they were found lying motionless on their faces
as though they had never existed
The people of Thamud denied the existence of their Lord
How distant from the mercy of God had the people of Thamud gone
Our Messengers came to Abraham with glad news They said Peace be with you
He replied similarly After a short time he presented them with a roasted calf
but when he saw that their hands did not reach out for it he could not know who they were and became afraid of them
They said Do not be afraid we are God s angelic Messengers sent to the people of Lot
His wife who was standing nearby smiled and so We gave her the glad news that she would give birth to Isaac who would have a son Jacob
She said Woe is me
How can I have a baby when I am barren and my husband is very old
This is certainly strange
They replied Would you be surprised at God s decree
People of the house may God s mercy and blessings be with you
God is Appreciative and Glorious
When Abraham had controlled his fear and received the glad news he started to plead with Us for the people of Lot
Abraham was certainly a forbearing compassionate and tenderhearted person
We said Abraham avoid asking Us such questions
Your Lord s decree has already been issued and an inevitable torment will strike these people
When Our Messengers came to Lot he became sorrowful and felt totally helpless He said This is indeed a distressful day
His people who had constantly indulged in evil deeds came running to him
He said My people here are my pure daughters
Have fear of God and do not humiliate me before my guests
Is there no person of understanding among you
They said You certainly know that we have no right to your daughters and you know what we want
He said Would that I had the power to overcome you or could seek strong protection
Our Messengers said Lot we are the Messengers of your Lord
They will never harm you
Leave the town with your family in the darkness of night and do not let any of you turn back
As for your wife she will suffer what they unbelievers will suffer
Their appointed time will come at dawn
Surely dawn is not far away
When Our decree came to pass We turned the town upsidedown and showered unto it lumps of baked clay
marked by your Lord
Such a punishment is not far away from the unjust people
To the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu ayb who told them My people worship God He is your only Lord Do not be dishonest in your weighing and measuring I can see you are safe and prosperous but I am afraid for you of the overwhelming torment of the appointed day
My people be just in your weighing and measuring
Do not defraud people or spread evil in the land
If you are true believers then know that the profit which God has left for you is better for you than what you may gain through deceitful ways
I am not responsible for your deeds
They asked him Shu ayb do your prayers tell you that we must give up the worship of what our fathers had worshipped and that we must not deal with our properties as we like
We still believe that you are a person of forbearance and understanding
He said My people do you not realize that I have received authoritative evidence from my Lord and have been granted a noble gift from Him
I do not want to oppose or ignore what I have prohibited you not to do
I only intend to reform you as much as I can
My success is in the hands of God
I trust Him and turn to Him in repentance
My people do not let your opposition to me lead you to commit sins or make you suffer what the people of Noah Hud and Salih suffered
Remember that the people of Lot were destroyed not very long ago
Seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance
My Lord is certainly Allmerciful and Loving
They said Shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say but we know that you are weak among us
Had it not been for our respect of your tribe we would have stoned you to death you are not very dear to us
He asked them My people is my tribe more respectable to you than God whom you have completely ignored
My Lord certainly has full control over your deeds
My people do as you wish and I will do as I believe
You will soon know who will suffer a humiliating torment and who was the one telling lies
Wait and I too will be waiting with you
When Our decree came to pass We mercifully saved Shu ayb and his faithful followers
A blast struck the unjust and left them in their homes lying motionless on their faces
as though they had never existed
How far from the mercy of God had the people of Midian gone just as those of Thamud
We sent Moses to the Pharaoh and his nobles with Our miracles and a clear authority
They followed the order of the Pharaoh but Pharaoh s orders were evil
On the Day of Judgment he will lead his people down into the hell fire His leadership is evil and terrible is the place to which he leads
They are condemned in this world and in the life to come
Evil is the gift and the recipient
Such were the stories of the nations of the past which We tell to you Muhammad
Some of them were destroyed and some of them have survived
We were not unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
The idols which they worshipped instead of God were of no help to them when Our decree came to pass The idols only brought about their destruction
Thus was the punishment of your Lord when He punished the unjust people of the towns
The punishment of your Lord is certainly severe
In this there is certainly a lesson for those who fear the torment of the next life in which all people will be gathered together
during a single day We have deferred this day for an appointed time
On the Day of Judgment no one will speak without the permission of God
Some will be condemned and others blessed
The condemned ones will live in hell fire sighing and groaning
for as long as the heavens and the earth exist unless your Lord decides otherwise
Your Lord will certainly accomplish whatever He wants
The blessed ones will live in Paradise as long as the heavens and the earth exist unless your Lord decides to grant endless rewards to whomever He wants
Have no doubt that these people worship idols
They worship what their fathers had worshipped before them
We will give them the exact recompense that they deserve
We gave the Book to Moses but people had different views about it
Had the Word of your Lord not been already ordained He would have settled their differences there and then
They are still in doubt about this
God will certainly recompense everyone according to their deeds He knows well all that you do
Muhammad be steadfast in your faith just as you have been commanded
Those who have turned to God in repentance with you should also be steadfast in their faith
Do not indulge in rebellion God is certainly aware of what you do
Do not be inclined towards the unjust ones lest you will be afflicted by the hell fire
Besides God no one can be your protector nor will anyone be able to help you
Say your prayers in the morning the last portion of the day and at the beginning of the night
Good deeds do away with the bad deeds
This is a reminder for those who take heed
Exercise patience God does not ignore the reward of those who do good
Why were there no people of understanding among those people of the destroyed towns of the past except for a few whom we saved from destruction to prevent people from committing evil in the land
The unjust among them indulged in worldly pleasures and so became guilty
Your Lord would not have destroyed those people of the towns for their injustice if they had tried to reform themselves
Had your Lord wanted He would have made all people one united nation
They still have different beliefs
except those upon whom God has granted His mercy
God has created them to receive mercy
The decree of your Lord that He will fill hell with both jinn and human beings has already been ordained
Muhammad We tell you all the stories of the Messengers which will strengthen your heart
In the Quran We have revealed the Truth to you with good advice and reminders for the faithful ones
Tell the unbelievers Do as you wish and I will do as I believe
Wait and I too will be waiting with you
To God belongs the knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and the earth and to Him do all affairs return
Worship Him and trust Him
Your Lord is not unaware of what you do
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the illustrious Book
We have revealed it in the Arabic language so that you people would understand it
In revealing this Quran to you We tell you the best of the stories of which you were unaware
When Joseph said Father in my dream I saw eleven stars the sun and the moon prostrating before me
his father said My son do not tell your dream to your brothers lest they plot against you satan is the sworn enemy of man
Thus your Lord will select you teach you the interpretation of dreams and grant His favors to you and the family of Jacob just as He granted His favors to your fathers Abraham and Isaac
Your Lord is certainly Allknowing and Allwise
In the story of Joseph and his brothers there is evidence of the truth for those who seek to know
Joseph s brothers said to one another There is no doubt that Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father even though we are all his offspring
He our father is certainly in manifest error
Some of them suggested Let us kill Joseph or leave him somewhere far away from the presence of our father
Only then shall we receive equal treatment and thereafter can become righteous people
One of them said Do not kill Joseph but if you must throw him into a dark well so that perhaps some caravan will take him away
Then they asked their father Why do you not trust us with Joseph We are his wellwishers
Send him with us tomorrow to play with us and enjoy himself
We shall carefully protect him
Jacob replied I shall be grieved if you take him with you I fear that some wildbeast will harm him in your absence
They said If some wildbeast would be able to harm him despite the presence of our strong group it would certainly be a great loss to us
When they took Joseph with them they agreed to throw him into the well
We revealed to Joseph that sometime in the future at a time when they would not recognize him he would remind them of all this
In the evening they returned to their father weeping
and saying Father we went playing and left Joseph with our belongings A wildbeast came and devoured him
We realize that you will not believe us even though we are telling the truth
They presented him with a shirt stained with false blood
Jacob said Your souls have tempted you in this matter
Let us be patient and beg assistance from God if what you say is true
A caravan came by and sent their water carrier out to the well
When he drew out Joseph in his bucket he shouted Glad news a young boy
The people of the caravan hid him amongst their belongings
God knows well what they do
In selling him they asked for a very small price and even then no one wanted to buy him
The Egyptian who bought him said to his wife Be kind to him perhaps he will be of some benefit to us or we may adopt him
Thus We settled Joseph in the land so that We could teach him the interpretation of dreams
God has full control over His affairs but most people do not know
When he attained maturity God gave him strength wisdom and knowledge
Thus do We reward those who do good
His master s wife then tried to seduce him
She locked the doors and said to him Come on
He said I seek refuge in God who has given me a good place of shelter
The unjust will certainly have no happiness
She was determined to have him and were it not for his faith in God he would certainly have yielded to her
Thus did We protect him from evil and indecency
He was certainly one of Our sincere servants
She chased him to the door grabbed him from behind and tore off his shirt
Suddenly they were face to face with her husband
Looking accusingly at Joseph she asked her husband What punishment is more fitting for those who have evil desires towards your household other than imprisonment and painful torment
Joseph said It was she who tried to seduce me
Someone from the household in confirmation of Joseph s statement said If his shirt it torn from the front she has spoken the truth and he is lying
but if his shirt is torn from behind she is lying and he is speaking the truth
When the master saw that Joseph s shirt was torn from behind he told his wife This is some of your womanly guile in which you are certainly skillful
Joseph stay away from such affairs and you woman ask forgiveness for your sin the guilt is yours
Some of the women in the town started to gossip saying The King s wife has tried to seduce her servant and has fallen madly in love with him
We think that she is in manifest error
When she heard their gossiping she invited them to her house for a banquet and gave a knife to each of them
Then she told Joseph to appear before them
When they saw Joseph they were so amazed that they cut their hands and said Goodness gracious
He is not a mortal but is a charming angel
She said This is the one on whose account you subjected me to all this blame
I tried to seduce him but he abstained
If he does not yield to me I shall order him to be locked up in prison to make him humble
Joseph said Lord prison is dearer to me than that which women want me to do
Unless You protect me from their guile I shall be attracted to them in my ignorance
His Lord heard his prayers and protected him from their guile He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Even after Joseph had been found innocent of any crime the King and his people decided to imprison him for an appointed time so that people would forget the incident
Two young men were also sent to serve prison sentences for different reasons One of them said I had a dream in which I was brewing wine
The other one said In my dream I was carrying some bread on my head and birds were eating that bread
They asked Joseph if he would interpret their dreams
They said We believe you to be a righteous person
Joseph said To prove that my interpretation of your dream is true I can tell you what kind of food you will receive even before it comes to you
My Lord has given me such talents
I have given up the tradition of the people who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment
and I have embraced the religion of my fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
We are not supposed to consider anything equal to God
This is part of God s blessing to us and the people but most people do not give thanks
My fellowprisoners can many different masters be considered better than One Alldominant God
What you worship instead of God are no more than empty names that you and your fathers have given to certain things
God has not given any authority to such names
Judgment belongs to no one but God
He has commanded you to worship nothing but Him
This is the only true religion but most people do not know
Fellowprisoners your dreams tell that one of you will serve wine to his master and the other will be crucified and his head consumed by the birds
Judgment has already been passed about the meaning of the dreams that you asked about
Joseph asked the one whom he knew would not be executed to mention his case to his Lord
Satan caused that man to forget all about Joseph and his case Thus Joseph remained in prison for some years
Sometimes later the King dreamt that seven lean cows were eating seven fat ones and that there were seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones
He asked the nobles to tell him the meaning of his dream if they were able to
They replied It is a confused dream and we do not know the meaning of such dreams
The man who was in prison with Joseph and who was released recalled after so many years Joseph s ability to interpret dreams and said I can tell you the meaning of this dream if you allow me to go to the prison and ask the man who knows the meanings of dreams
He went to the prison and said to Joseph You are a man of truth
Would you tell me the meaning of a dream in which seven fat cows eat up seven lean ones and the meaning of seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones
I hope you can tell me the right meaning and save people from confusion
Joseph said Cultivate your lands for seven years as usual and preserve the produce with its ears each year except the little amount that you will consume
After this will ensue seven years of famine in which all the grain that you have stored will be consumed except a small quantity
Then there will be a year with plenty of rain and people will have sufficient milk and other produce
The King ordered his people to bring Joseph into his presence
When the messenger came to Joseph he Joseph said Ask your master about the women who cut their hands
My Lord knows all about their guile
The King asked the women about their attempt to seduce Joseph
They replied God forbid
We do not know of any bad in Joseph
The wife of the King said Now the truth has come to light
It was I who tried to seduce Joseph
He is certainly a truthful man
Joseph said This proves that I was not disloyal to the King in his absence God does not grant success to the efforts of disloyal people
I do not think that I am free from weakness all human souls are susceptible to evil except for those to whom my Lord has granted mercy
My Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The King ordered his men to bring Joseph before him
He wanted to grant him a high office The King said to Joseph From now on you will be an honored and trusted person among us
Joseph said Put me in charge of the treasuries of the land I know how to manage them
Thus We settled Joseph in the land to live wherever he wanted
We grant a due share of Our mercy to whomever We want and We do not ignore the reward of the righteous ones
The reward in the next life is certainly better for the faithful ones who have observed piety in this life
Joseph s brothers came to him When they entered his court he recognized them
They did not know him
When he had furnished them with provisions he said Next time bring me your other brother from your father
As you can see I give each of you a certain amount of grain I am a polite host
If you do not bring him do not come to us for we shall not give you any more grain
Joseph s brothers said We shall try to influence his father to send him with us and we shall be successful
Then Joseph told his people to put his brothers money back into their bags so that perhaps they would recognize it when at home and come back to Egypt once again
When they returned to their father they told him Father unless we take our brother they will refuse us one further measure of grain
Send our brother with us so that we can obtain that measure
We shall watch over him carefully
Jacob replied How can I trust you after what happened to his brother before Only God is the best Protector
His mercy is far greater than that of others
When they opened their baggage they found that their money had been returned to them
They said Father what more do we want
Our money has been given back to us
We can buy more provisions with this for our family We shall protect our brother and have one more camel load of grain which is easy to get
Jacob said I shall not send him with you until you solemnly promise me before God to return him to me unless you are prevented from doing so
When they gave their promise he said God is the Witness of what we have said
Jacob then told his sons Do not enter the town all together by a single gate but each of you enter separately
I cannot help you against the decree of God
Everyone s destiny is in His hands
I put my trust in Him
Whoever needs a trustee must put his trust in God
Even though they entered the town as their father had told them it would not have been of any avail to them against the decree of God
It only served to satisfy Jacob s desire and judgment
He was certainly well versed by Our instruction but most people do not know
When they entered Joseph s court he gave lodging to his own brother Benjamin and said I am your brother
Do not feel sad about whatever they had done
When he had furnished them with provisions he placed the King s drinking cup in his own brother s baggage
Then someone shouted People of the caravan you are thieves
Joseph s brothers turned around and asked What is missing
They were told The King s drinking cup is missing and whoever brings it will receive a camel s load of grain
I promise you that
Joseph s brothers said We swear by God as you know that we have not come to spread evil in the land and that we have not committed any theft
The Egyptians said What do you suggest should be the punishment for the thief if it is proved that you are lying
Joseph s brothers replied In whosoever baggage it is found that person will be your bondsman
Thus is the punishment of the unjust
They searched their baggage before that of Joseph s real brother where at last they found it
Thus We showed Joseph how to plan this he would not have been able to take his brother under the King s law unless God had wanted it to be so
We give a high rank to whomever We want
Over every knowledgeable person is one more knowing
Joseph s brothers said It s no wonder that he steals a brother of his had stolen before him
Joseph noted their remarks but did not utter a word
He said to himself You are in a worse position God knows best what you allege
They said Noble Prince his father is very old so please take one of us in his place
We believe that you are a righteous person
He replied God forbid
How could I take someone in place of the thief
In doing so I would be committing injustice
When they lost all hope of convincing the Prince they moved into a corner whispering to each other
The eldest among them said Do you not remember that you had solemnly promised our father to return Benjamin to him and that before this you had broken your promise concerning Joseph
I shall never leave this land until my father gives me permission or God decides for me He is the best Judge
Go to our father and tell him Father your son committed theft We say only what we have seen and we have no control over the unseen
You can ask the people of the town where we were and the caravan we met there
We are certainly telling the truth
When he heard this Jacob said Your souls have tempted you to make up the whole story Let us be patient for perhaps God will bring them all back to me God is certainly Allknowing and Allwise
Jacob turned away from them saying Alas Joseph is lost
He wept continuously in his grief until in suppressing his anger his eyes turned white
They said You are always remembering Joseph By God it will either make you sick or you will die
He replied I only complain of my sorrow and grief to God I know about God what you do not know
My sons go and search for Joseph and his brother and do not despair of receiving comfort from God only the unbelievers despair of receiving comfort from Him
When they entered Joseph s court they said Noble Prince hardship has struck us and our people
We have come with a little money so give us a measure of grain and be charitable to us
God will give the reward to those who give charity
Joseph asked them Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance
Then they inquired Are you Joseph
He said Yes I am Joseph and this is my brother
God has indeed been gracious to us
One who exercises patience and observes piety should know that God does not ignore the reward of the righteous ones
They said We swear by God that He has given preference to you over us and we have sinned
Joseph said No one will blame you on this day God will forgive you He is more Merciful than others
Take my shirt and place it unto my father s face This will restore his eyesight
Then bring the whole family to me
When the caravan left the town their father said I smell Joseph s scent I hope that you will not accuse me of senility
His people said By God you are still making the same old error
When someone brought him the glad news Joseph s shirt was placed on his face and his eyesight was restored he said Did I not tell you that I know about God that which you do not know
They said Father ask God to forgive our sins we have certainly sinned
He said I shall ask my Lord to forgive you He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When they all came to Joseph he welcomed his parents and said Enter the town in peace if God wants it to be so
He raised his parents on the throne and they prostrated themselves before him Joseph
He said This is the meaning of my dream which God has made come true
He has granted me many favors
He set me free from prison and brought you to me from the desert after having ended the enmity which satan sowed between my brothers and I My Lord is certainly kind to whomever He wants
It is He who is Allforgiving and Allwise
My Lord You have given me the kingdom and taught me the meaning of dreams
You are the Creator of the heavens and the earth
You are my Guardian in this world and in the life to come
Make me die as one who has submitted to the Will of God and unite me with the righteous ones
This is some of the news of the unseen which We reveal to you Muhammad
You were not with them when Joseph s brothers agreed on devising their evil plans
However hard you try most people will not believe
You do not ask any reward for your preaching of Our guidance to them
This Quran is a guide for the people of the world human beings and jinn
There is much evidence of the existence of God in the heavens and the earth which they see but ignore
Most of them do not believe in God they are but pagans
Do they feel safe from God s overwhelming torment or of the sudden approach of the Day of Judgment while they are unaware
Muhammad say This is my way
I and all my followers invite you to God with proper understanding
God is most Glorious
I am not a pagan
The Messengers whom We sent before you were mere men of the people of the towns We gave them revelations
Have they the unbelievers not travelled sufficiently through the land to see how terrible the end was of those who lived before
The next life is certainly better for the pious ones
Will you not then take heed
When at last the Messengers lost all hope of achieving success in their task and thought that everyone had called them liars We gave them victory and saved whomever We chose to save
The guilty ones can not escape Our wrath
In their story there is a lesson for the people of understanding
It is not a legend but a confirmation of what exists in the Torah It the Quran has details about everything
It is a guide and mercy for those who have faith
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book
Whatever is revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth but most people do not believe
God is the One Who raised the heavens without a pillar as you can see Then He established his control over the realm and made the sun and moon subservient to Him
Each of them will remain in motion for an appointed time He regulates all affairs and explains the evidence of His existence so that perhaps you will be certain of your meeting with your Lord
It is God who spread out the earth and fixed mountains and placed rivers therein He made a pair of every fruit and made the night cover the day
All this is evidence of the existence of God for the people who think
In the earth there are adjacent pieces of land vineyards farms datepalms of single and many roots which are all watered by the same water
We have made some yield a better food than others
All this is evidence of the existence of God for the people who understand
If there is anything to make you wonder it would be the words of those who say When we become dust shall we be brought back to life again
They are disbelievers in their Lord and will wear heavy fetters around their necks
They are the dwellers of the hell fire wherein they will live forever
They ask you to bring upon them punishment before they ask you for mercy
Such punishments were already brought upon the people who lived before them
Your Lord certainly has forgiveness for the injustice of the people
He is also stern in His retribution
The unbelievers say Why has God not sent him Muhammad some miracles
Muhammad you are only a warner
For every nation there is a guide
God knows well what every female conceives
He knows what the wombs spoil and dispose of
In His plans everything has been designed proportionately
He knows all the unseen and seen
He is the most Great and High
It is all the same to Him whether you speak in secret or out loud try to hide in the darkness of night or walk in the brightness of day
Everyone is guarded and protected on all sides by the order of God
God does not change the condition of a nation unless it changes what is in its heart
When God wants to punish a people there is no way to escape from it and no one besides God will protect them from it
It is God who flashes lightning to frighten you and to give you hope It is He who forms the heavy clouds
Both the thunder and the angels glorify Him and out of His fear always praise Him
He sends down thunderbolts to strike whomever He wants while they are busy arguing about the existence of God
His punishment is stern
Prayer to Him is the true prayer
Those to whom they pray instead of God will answer none of their prayers
It is as though one stretches his hands out to the water that can never reach his mouth
The prayers of the unbelievers will get nowhere
All in the heavens and the earth prostrate themselves before God either of their own free will or by force just as do their shadows in the mornings and evenings
Muhammad ask them Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
Say It is God
Ask them Why then have you taken guardians other than God when such guardians can neither benefit nor harm themselves
Ask them Are the seeing and the blind equal Is light equal to darkness
Do they consider that their idols have created anything like that of God thus both creations appear to them to be alike
Say God alone is the Creator of all things and He is the One the AllDominant
When God sends down water from the sky and floods run through the valleys certain quantities of foam rise on the surface of the flood water
This is similar to that foam which rises when you expose something to the heat of a fire to manufacture ornaments or for other reasons
To God Truth and falsehood are like these examples
The foam disappears but what is profitable to the human being stays in the land
Thus does God coin His parables
Those who answer the call of their Lord will receive good rewards
Whatever those who have not answered the call of their Lord offer to redeem themselves even if they offer double the wealth of the whole earth will not be accepted
They will face a terrible reckoning and their dwelling will be hell a terrible place to rest
Can a person who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth be considered equal to a blind person
Only those who have understanding take heed
Those who fulfill their promise to and covenant with God
who maintain all the proper relations that God has commanded them to maintain who have fear of their Lord and the hardships of the Day of Judgment
who exercise patience to gain God s pleasure who are steadfast in prayer who spend for the cause of God privately and in public and who keep away evil with good will have a blissful end
They will be admitted to the gardens of Eden wherein they will live forever with their righteous fathers spouses and offspring
The angels will come to them through every gate
saying Peace be with you for all that you have patiently endured
Blessed is the reward of Paradise
Those who disregard their covenant with God after He has taken such a pledge from them who sever the proper relations that God has commanded them to establish and those who spread evil in the land will have God s condemnation instead of reward and will face the most terrible end
God gives abundant sustenance to whomever He wants and determines everyone s destiny
Some people are very happy with the worldly life Compared to the life to come it is only a temporary means
The unbelievers say Why have not some miracles been sent to him Muhammad from his Lord
Say God causes whomever He wants to go astray and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance
and the faithful ones whose hearts are comforted by the remembrance of God
Remembrance of God certainly brings comfort to all hearts
The righteously striving believers will receive abundant blessings and the best eternal dwelling
We have sent you to a nation before whom there lived many nations so that you would read to them what We have revealed to you
They still deny the existence of the Beneficent God
Say He is my Lord besides whom there is no other God
I trust Him and turn to Him in repentance
Even if the Quran would make mountains move cut the earth into pieces and make the dead able to speak the unbelievers still would not believe
All affairs are in the hands of God
Do the believers still hope that they will believe
Had God wanted he could have guided the whole of mankind to the right path
The unbelievers will always suffer afflictions that result from their deeds or the affliction which occur near their homes until God s promise of punishing them will be fulfilled
God does not disregard His promise
Muhammad people have mocked the Messengers who lived before you
I gave a respite to the unbelievers so that they would repent but they did not
Then I struck them with a terrible retribution
Can anyone be considered equal to the One who is the Guardian of every soul and the Watcher of what it has gained
Yet the unbelievers have considered their idols equal to God
Say Name the attributes of your idols
Are you trying to tell God about something that does not exist on the earth
Do you only mention empty names
Evil plans have attracted the unbelievers and have misled them from the right path
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray
The unbelievers will face torment in this world and their punishment in the life hereafter will be even greater
No one can save them from the wrath of God
The gardens which have been promised to the pious have flowing streams everlasting fruits and perpetual shade
Such is the blissful end of the pious but hell fire is the terrible end for the unbelievers
The People of the Book are happy with what has been revealed to you
Among the different parties there are some who dislike part of what has been revealed to you
Muhammad tell them I have been commanded to worship God alone not to consider anything equal to Him
To Him do I pray and to Him shall I return
We revealed it the Quran as a code of conduct in the Arabic language
Muhammad if you follow their desires after the knowledge has been revealed to you know that no one will be able to guard or protect you from the wrath of God
We sent Messengers before you Muhammad and gave them wives and offspring No Messenger was to show miracles without the permission of God
For every event God has ordained His decree God establishes or effaces whatever He wants and with Him is the original of the Book
Whether We show them the unbelievers to you facing the punishment with which We had threatened them or make you die first before its fulfillment your duty is only to preach
It is up to Us to call them to account for their deeds
Have they not considered that We have taken over the land and reduced its borders
It is God who issues the irreversible decree and His reckoning is swift
Certain people who lived before plotted evil plans but God is the Master of all plans
He knows what every soul does
The unbelievers will soon learn who will achieve the blissful end
Muhammad the unbelievers say You are not a Messenger
Say God and those who have the knowledge of the Book are sufficient witness to my prophethood
Alif
Lam Ra
A Book has been revealed to you Muhammad so that by the permission of their Lord you would be able to lead people from darkness into light along the path of the Majestic Praised One
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
Woe to the disbelievers they will face the most severe punishment
It is they who have given preference to the worldly life over the life to come They create obstacles in the way that leads to God and try to make it seem crooked
They are in manifest error
All the Messengers that We sent spoke the language of their people so that they could explain their message to them
God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
He is Majestic and Allwise
We sent Moses and gave him miracles in order to lead his people from darkness into light and to remind them of the days of God
In this there is evidence of the truth for those who exercise patience and give thanks
Moses told his people Remember the favors that God granted you when He saved you from the people of the Pharaoh who had punished you in the worst manner by murdering your sons and keeping your women alive
It was a great trial for you from your Lord
Remember when your Lord said to you If you give thanks I shall give you greater favors but if you deny the Truth know that My retribution is severe
Moses told his people If you and everyone on the earth turn to disbelief know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Have you believers ever heard the news about those who lived before you like the people of Noah Ad Thamud and those who lived after them
No one knows about them except God
Messengers were sent to them with miracles but they put their hands to their mouths and said We do not believe in whatever you preach and we are also doubtful and uncertain about that to which you invite us
The Messengers asked them Could there be any doubt about the existence of God who has created the heavens and the earth He calls you to Himself to forgive your sins
He gives you respite only until the appointed time
They said You are mere mortals like us
What you want is to prevent us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped Show us clear proof if what you say is true
The Messengers replied We are certainly mere mortals like you but God bestows His favors on whichever of His servants He wants
We can not bring you authority without the permission of God
The faithful should trust in God alone
Why should we not trust in God when He has shown us the right way
We shall exercise patience against the troubles with which you afflict us
Whoever needs a trustee should trust in God
The disbelievers told the Messengers We shall expel you from our land unless you revert to our religion
Their Lord then sent them the messengers a revelation We have decided to destroy the unjust
and settle you in the land thereafter
This is for those who are afraid of Me and of My warning
They prayed for victory and the haughty transgressors were defeated
Thereafter they will face hell fire wherein they will drink boiling water
As they sip the unpleasant water death will approach them from all sides but they will never die
In addition to this they will experience the most intense torment
The deeds of those who deny the existence of their Lord are like ashes blown about by a strong wind on a stormy day
They will achieve nothing from their deeds
What they have done is a manifest error
Do you not realize that God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
and that it is not at all difficult for God to replace you with another creature if He so wills
On the Day of Judgment everyone will appear before God and those who have been suppressed will say to their oppressors We were your followers can you do anything to rescue us from the torment of God
They will reply Had God guided us we would also have guided you
It makes no difference whether we cry for help or exercise patience there is no escape for us
When the decree of God is issued satan will say God s promise to you was true but I too made a promise to you and disregarded it
I had no authority over you
I just called you and you answered
Do not blame me but blame yourselves
I cannot help you and you cannot help me
I did not agree with your belief that I was equal to God
The unjust will face a painful punishment
The righteously striving believers will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever by the permission of their Lord
Their greeting to each other will be Peace be with you
Consider Muhammad how God in a parable compares the blessed Word to that of a blessed tree which has firm roots and branches rising up into the sky
and yields fruits in every season by the permission of its Lord
God sets forth parables for people so that they may take heed
An evil word is compared to an evil tree with no firm roots in the land and thus has no stability
God strengthens the faith of the believers by the true Words in this world and in the life to come
He causes the unjust to go astray and does whatever He pleases
Have you not seen those who changed the Word of God through disbelief and led their people to destruction
They will suffer in Hell
What a terrible place to stay
To lead people astray they claimed their idols were equal to God
Muhammad tell them Enjoy yourselves and know that the only place for you to go will be hell fire
Tell My believing servants to be steadfast in prayer and to spend for the cause of their Lord both in private and in public out of what We have given them Let them do this before the coming of the day when there will be no merchandising or friendship
God is the One who created the heavens and the earth sent down water from the sky by which He produced fruits for your sustenance enabled you to use boats to sail on the sea and placed the rivers at your disposal all by His command
He made the sun and moon each following its course and the day and the night all subservient to you
He has given you everything that you asked Him for
Had you wanted to count the bounties of God you would not have been able to do it
The human being is unjust and disbelieving
Muhammad consider when Abraham prayed Lord make this Mecca a peaceful territory and save me and my offspring from worshipping idols
Lord the idols have misled many people
Whoever follows me is my friend
As for those who disobey You are certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Lord I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near your Sacred House so that they could be steadfast in prayer Lord fill the hearts of the people with love for them and produce fruits for their sustenance so that they may give thanks
Lord You know all that we conceal or reveal
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from God
It is only God who deserves all praise I praise Him for His giving me my sons Ishmael and Isaac during my old age
My Lord certainly hears all prayers
Lord make me and my offspring steadfast in prayer and accept our worship
Lord on the Day of Judgment forgive me and my parents and all the believers
Muhammad do not think that God is unaware of what the unjust people do
He only gives them a respite until the day when the eyes will stare fixedly
when people will hurry in fright their heads raised their eyes unable to look around and their hearts stunned due to the confusion which will prevail on that Day
Muhammad warn the people of the day when torment will approach them and the unjust will say Lord give us respite for a little time so that we may answer your call and follow the Messengers The answer to their prayer will be Did you not swear before that you would never perish
You lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves even though it was made clear to you how We dealt with them
We also showed you examples
They devised evil plans which were so sinful that even the mountains could not endure them
All these were known to God
You must not even think that God will disregard His promise to His messengers
God is Majestic and Revengeful
On the day when the earth and the heavens will be replaced by another earth and heavens and everyone will be brought before the One Almighty God
you will see the guilty ones bound in chains
with garments of pitch and faces covered by fire
This is how God will recompense each soul for its deeds
God s reckoning is swift
This is an admonition for the people that they will be warned and know that He is the only God and so that the people of understanding may take heed
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book and the glorious Quran
How strongly the unbelievers will wish that they had been Muslims
Muhammad leave them alone to eat and enjoy themselves and let their desires deceive them they will soon know the Truth
We never destroyed any town without preordaining the fate of its people
Every nation can only live for the time appointed for it
The unbelievers have said You to whom the Quran has been revealed are insane
Why do you not bring down the angels if what you say is true
We do not send down angels except for a genuine purpose at which time none will be given any further respite
We Ourselves have revealed the Quran and We are its Protectors
We sent Messengers to the ancient people who lived before you
No Messenger went to them whom they did not mock
This is how We cause the hearts of the guilty ones to behave
They do not believe in the Truth and they exactly follow the tradition of the ancient unbelievers
Had We opened a door for them in the sky through which they could easily pass
they would have said Our eyes are bewildered and we have been affected by magic
We have made constellations in the sky and decorated them for the onlookers
We have protected them from every condemned devil
except for those who stealthily try to listen to the heavens but who are chased away by a bright flame
We have spread out the earth fixed mountains thereupon and caused everything to grow to its proper weight
to provide you and those for whose sustenance you are not responsible with the necessities of life
With Us is the source of everything and We do not send it down except in a known quantity
We send impregnating winds and send down water from the sky for you to drink and you have no control over its storage
It is We who give life and cause things to die and We are the sole Heirs
We know the people who lived before you and those who will come into existence after you
Your Lord will resurrect them all He is Allwise and Allknowing
We have created the human being out of pure mudmoulded clay
and the jinn before the human being of smokeless fire
When your Lord said to the angels I will create the human being out of pure mudmoulded clay
When it is properly shaped and I have blown My Spirit into it you should then bow down in prostration
All the angels prostrated before Adam
except Iblis who refused to join with the others in prostration
God asked Iblis What made you not join the others in prostration
Iblis replied I did not want to prostrate before a human being whom You have created out of mudmoulded clay
God told him Get out of the garden you are rejected
and will be subjected to condemnation until the Day of Judgment
Iblis prayed Lord grant me respite until the Day of Judgment
The Lord said Your request is granted
for an appointed time
Iblis said Lord because you have caused me to go astray I shall make earthly things attractive to people and mislead all of them
except Your sincere servants
God said The path which leads to Me is a straight
and you have no authority over My servants except the erring ones who follow you
Hell is the promised place for them all
It has seven gates and each gate is assigned for a certain group of people
The pious will live in gardens with streams
and they will be told to enter there in peace and safety
We shall remove all hatred from their breasts and make them as brothers reclining on thrones facing one another
No fatigue will touch them nor will they be expelled therefrom
Muhammad tell My servants that I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
and that My punishment is a painful one
Tell them about the guests of Abraham
who came to him saying Peace be with you
Abraham said We are afraid of you
They replied Do not be afraid We have brought you the glad news of the birth of a learned son
Abraham asked Are you giving me the glad news of a son in my old age
What reason can you give for such glad news
They said We have given you the glad news for a true reason so do not despair
He said No one despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are in error
Messengers what is your task
They said We are sent to a sinful people
Only the family of Lot will all be saved
except his wife who is doomed to be left behind
When the Messengers came to the family of Lot
he said You seem to be strangers
They replied We have come to you about the matter which the unbelievers have rejected
We have come to you for a genuine purpose and We are true in what we say
Leave the town with your family sometime during the night
Walk behind them and let no one turn around
Proceed as you are commanded
We informed him that the unbelievers would be utterly destroyed
The people of the town rejoicingly
rushed towards the house of Lot
Lot said to them These are my guests
Do not disgrace me
Have fear of God and do not humiliate me
They replied Did we not forbid you to bring anyone to your house
Lot said These are my daughters if you want them
By your life
In their drunkenness they were truly blind
An explosion struck them at sunrise
We turned the town upsidedown and showered on them lumps of baked clay
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the prudent ones
That town lies on a road which still exists
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the believers
Since the People of the Forest were unjust
We afflicted them with punishment
Both people had clear divine authority among them
People of Hijr rejected the Messengers
We showed them miracles but they ignored them
They would carve secure houses out of the mountains
An explosion struck them in the morning
Out of what they had gained nothing proved to be of any benefit to them
We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a genuine purpose
The Day of Judgment will certainly approach so Muhammad forgive them graciously
Your Lord is certainly the Allknowing Creator
Muhammad We have given you the seven most repeated verses and the great Quran
Do not yearn for other people s property and wives and do not grieve that they do not believe Be kind to the believers
Say Indeed I am simply one who warns
We have given you the Quran as We had given the Bible to those who divided themselves into groups
and also divided the Quran believing in some parts and rejecting others
By the Lord We will hold them all responsible
for what they have done
Preach what you have been commanded to and stay away from the pagans
We shall help you against those who mock you
and believe other things to be equal to God
They will soon know the truth
We certainly know that you feel sad about what they say against you
Glorify and praise your Lord and be with those who prostrate themselves before God
Worship your Lord until you achieve the ultimate certainty
God s help will certainly support the believers so pagans do not seek to hasten it God is too Glorious and Exalted to be considered equal to idols
He sends the angels with the Spirit to carry His orders to whichever of His servants He wants so that they would warn people that He is the only God and that people must have fear of Him
He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose He is too Exalted to be considered equal to anything else
He created the human being from a drop of fluid but the human being openly disputes His Word
He created cattle which provide you with clothes food and other benefits
How beautiful you find them when you bring them home and when you drive them out to graze
They carry your heavy loads to lands which you would not have been able to reach without great difficulty
Your Lord is certainly Compassionate and AllMerciful
He created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as a means of beauty
He has also created things that you do not know
Some paths lead away from God but one must follow the path that leads to God
Had God wanted He could have guided all to the right path
It is God who sends down water from the sky for you to drink and produces plants as pasture for your cattle
With this water He causes corn olives palmtrees vines and all kinds of fruits to grow
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people of understanding
God has made the day and the night the sun and the moon and all the stars subservient to you by His command
In this there is evidence of the truth for people of understanding
All that He has created for you on the earth are of different colors
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the people who take heed
It is God who put the oceans at your disposal so that you could find therein fresh fish for food and ornaments with which to deck yourselves with You will find ships that sail for you so that you may travel in search of the bounties of God and give Him thanks
God has fixed the mountains on earth lest you should be hurled away when it quakes Therein He has also made rivers and roads so that you will find your way
The stars and other signs also help people to find their way
Is the One who can create equal to the one who cannot create anything
Why then will you not consider
Even if you wanted to count up all of God s blessings you would not be able to
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God knows all that you conceal or reveal
Whatever idols they worship besides God can create nothing for they are themselves created
They are not living but are dead
They can not know when they will be raised
Your Lord is only One
The hearts of those who do not believe in the life hereafter dislike the truth
They are puffed up with pride
God certainly knows whatever you conceal or reveal
He does not love the proud ones
When they are asked What has your Lord revealed to you they say Only ancient legends
Besides their own burdens on the Day of Judgment they will have to carry on the burdens of those whom they have misled without knowledge
How evil that burden will be
Those who went before them had also devised evil plans
God demolished their houses destroying their very foundations Their ceilings toppled on their heads and torment struck them from a direction which they had never expected
God will humiliate them on the Day of Judgment and ask them Where are the idols which you had considered equal to Me and which were the cause of hostility and animosity among you
The people who were given knowledge will say It is the unbelievers who face disgrace and trouble on this day
The unjust who will be seized by the angels will submit themselves obey and say We were not evildoers But God certainly knows what they had been doing
They will be commanded to enter hell to live therein forever
How terrible will be the place of the proud ones
The pious ones will be asked What did your Lord reveal to you They will reply He revealed only good
The share of the righteous ones is virtue in this world and greater virtue in the life to come
How blessed will be the dwelling of the pious ones
They will be admitted into the gardens of Eden wherein steams flow and they will have therein whatever they want
This is how God will reward the pious ones
They will be received by the angels of mercy with the greeting Peace be with you
Enter Paradise as a reward for your good deeds
Are they the disbelievers waiting for the angels and the decree of your Lord to be fulfilled before they believe
The people who lived before them had also done the same thing
God did not do injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The evil consequences of their deeds afflicted them and they were surrounded by what they had mocked
The pagans had said Had God wanted we would not have worshipped anything other than Him nor would our fathers
We would not have forbidden anything without a command from Him
The same thing was said by the people who lived before them Are the Messengers expected to do more than just preach
To every nation We sent a Messenger who told its people Worship God and stay away from satan
Some of them were guided by God and others were doomed to go astray
Travel through the land and see how terrible was the end for those who rejected the truth
Muhammad even though you have a strong desire to guide them be sure that God will not guide those who have gone astray and no one will be able to help them
They strongly swear by God that God will not bring the dead to life
God s promise of the Resurrection will certainly come true but many people do not know
Through the resurrection God wants to make a clear distinction between right and wrong and make the unbelievers know that they were liars
When We want to bring something into existence Our command is Exist and it comes into existence
God settles those who leave their homes for His cause after having suffered injustice in a prosperous dwelling in this life and greater rewards will be theirs in the life to come
Would that they knew this
It is they who have exercised patience and trust in their Lord
The Messengers whom We sent before you were mere mortals to whom We had sent with miracles and revelations Ask those who know about the heavenly Books if you do not know about this
We have revealed the Quran to you so that you could tell the people what has been revealed to them and so that perhaps they will think
Can they who have devised evil plans expect to be safe from the command of God to the earth to swallow them up or from a torment which might strike them from an unexpected direction
Are they confident that God will not seize them while they are on a journey
They will not be able to escape from God
Are they confident that God will not slowly destroy them
Your Lord is Compassionate and Allmerciful
Can they not see that the shadows of whatever God has created turn to the right and to the left in prostration and submission to Him
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth the cattle and the angels prostrate themselves before God without pride
They angels have fear of their Lord above them and fulfill His commands
God says Do not worship two gods
There is only One God
Have fear of Me
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God s retribution is severe
Should you then have fear of anyone other than God
Whatever bounties you have are from God
When hardship befalls you you begin to cry out to Him
When He saves you from the hardship some of you start to believe in idols
In the end you will reject Our bounties
Enjoy yourselves you will soon know the consequences of your deeds
They give to unknown images a share out of the sustenance that We gave them
By God you will be questioned about that which you have falsely invented
They ascribe daughters to God God is too Exalted to have daughters but they can have whatever they want
When the glad news of the birth of their daughter is brought to them their faces turn gloomy and black with anger
They try to hide themselves from the people because of the disgrace of such news
Will they keep their new born despite the disgrace or bury it alive
How sinful is their Judgment
Those who do not believe in the life to come are evil examples To God belongs all the exalted attributes He is the Majestic and the Allwise
Was God to seize people immediately for their injustice no living creature would be left on earth
He gives them respite for an appointed time
When their term is over they will not be able to change the inevitable
They ascribe to God that which even they themselves do not like and their lying tongues say that their end will be virtuous Their share will certainly be hell fire to which they are earnestly heading
By God We sent Messengers to nations who lived before you
Satan made their deeds seem attractive to them and on the Day of Judgment satan will be their guardian
For them there will be a painful punishment
We have sent you the Book for no other reason than to settle their differences and to be a guide and mercy for those who believe
God has sent down water from the sky and has brought the dead earth to life
In this there is evidence of the truth for those who listen carefully
There is a lesson for you to learn concerning cattle We provide pleasant milk for you to drink within the delicate system of their veins and arteries
The fruit of palm trees and vines which provide you with sugar and delicious food also provide a lesson and evidence of the Truth for the people of understanding
Your Lord inspired the bees Make hives in the mountains in the trees and in the trellises
then eat of every fruit and follow the path of your Lord submissively
From out of their bellies comes a drink of different color in which there is a cure for the human being
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
God has created you and He causes you to die
Some of you will grow to an extremely old age and lose your memory
God is Allknowing and Almighty
God has made some of you richer than others
The rich ones do not have to give away their property to their slaves to make them equally rich
Do they reject the bounties of God
God has created spouses for you from your own selves He has created your sons and grandsons from your spouses and has given you pure things for your sustenance
Do they then believe in falsehood and reject the bounties of God
Do they worship things other than God which neither provide them with any sustenance from the heavens and the earth nor have the ability to do so
Do not consider anything equal to God
God knows that which you do not know
God tells a parable about a helpless servant and one to whom He has given honorable provisions and who has spent for the cause of God privately and in public Can these two people be considered equal
It is only God who deserves all praise but most people do not know
God tells a parable about two men One of them is dumb and useless and a burden on his friend
Wherever he goes he returns with nothing
Can he be considered equal to the one who maintains justice and follows the right path
To God belongs all the secrets of the heavens and the earth
It only takes God a twinkling of an eye or even less to make it the Day of Judgment
God has power over all things
When God brought you out of your mothers wombs you knew nothing
He gave you ears eyes and hearts so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Have you not considered the free movements of the birds high in the sky above
What keeps them aloft except God
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
He has also made homes for you out of the skins of cattle which are easy to carry along on a journey or at a camp He has made wool fur and the hair of cattle a temporary means of enjoyment for you
God has provided shade for you out of what He has created and places of retreat out of mountains He has given you garments to protect you from the heat and cover your private parts
This is how He perfects His bounties to you so that perhaps you would submit to His will
Muhammad if they turn away your only duty is to clearly preach to them
They recognize the bounties of God but they refuse them and most of them are unbelievers
On the day when We will call a witness from every nation the disbelievers will not be given permission for anything nor will they be allowed to seek solicitation
There will be no relief for them when the torment approaches the unjust nor will they be given any respite
When the idolators see their idols they will say Lord these are the idols whom we worshipped instead of you
But the idols will say They are liars
On the Day of Judgment the disbelievers will submit themselves to God and whatever they had falsely invented will disappear
The disbelievers who had created obstacles in the way leading to God will face manifold torments as a result of their evil deeds
On the day when We call a witness against every nation from their own people We will call you Muhammad as a witness against them all
We have sent you the Book which clarifies all matters It is a guide a mercy and glad news to the Muslims
God commands people to maintain justice kindness and proper relations with their relatives He forbids them to commit indecency sin and rebellion
God gives you advice so that perhaps you will take heed
He commands people to keep their established covenants with God not to disregard their firm oaths they have already appointed God as their Guarantor
God certainly knows what you do
Do not be like the lady behind the spinning wheel who has broken the yarn by pulling it with unnecessary force
You must not consider your oaths as means of deceit to benefit one party and incur loss upon the other
God tests your faith by your oaths
He will make clear to you who was right and who was wrong on the Day of Judgment
Had God wanted He would have made you one single nation but He guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
You will certainly be questioned about what you have done
Do not consider your oaths as a means of deceit lest you damage the firmness of your faith suffer from evil by creating obstacles in the way that leads to God and incur a great torment upon yourselves
Do not sell your covenant with God for a small price
The reward which you will receive from God is better for you if only you knew it
Whatever you possess is transient and whatever is with God is everlasting
We will recompense those who exercise patience with their due reward and even more
All righteously believing male or female will be granted a blessed happy life and will receive their due reward and more
Muhammad when you recite the Quran seek refuge in God from the mischief of satan
Satan has certainly no authority over the believers who have trust in their Lord
The only authority which he has is over his friends and those who consider things equal to God
When God replaces one revelation with another He knows best what to reveal But they say Muhammad you have falsely invented it
Most people are ignorant
Muhammad say The Holy Spirit has brought the Quran from your Lord to you in all truth to strengthen the faith of the believers and to be a guide and glad news for the Muslims
We know that they say a mere mortal has taught it the Quran to him Muhammad
The language of the person whom they think has taught it to him is not Arabic
This the Quran is in illustrious Arabic
God will not guide those who do not believe in His miracles
They will suffer a painful punishment
Those who do not believe in the miracles of God invent lies and they are liars
No one verbally denounces his faith in God unless he is forced but his heart is confident about his faith
But those whose breasts have become open to disbelief will be subject to the wrath of God and will suffer a great torment
This is because they have given preference to this life over the life to come and God does not guide disbelieving people
God has sealed their hearts ears and eyes and they are not aware of it
On the Day of Judgment they will certainly be lost
Those who left their homes for the cause of God after they had been persecuted strove hard for His cause and exercised patience should know even though they had verbally renounced their faith that your Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
On the Day of Judgment every soul shall try to defend itself and every soul will be justly recompensed
God tells a parable about a secure and peaceful town surrounded by abundant sustenance
Its inhabitants rejected the bounties of God and He caused them to suffer hunger and fear as a result of their deeds
A Messenger from their own people came to them and they called him a liar Torment struck them because of their injustice
People consume the pure and lawful sustenance which God has given to you and thank God for his bounty if you are His true worshippers
The only things which are made unlawful for you are the flesh of dead animals blood pork and that which is not consecrated with the Name of God
But in an emergency without the intention of transgression and rebellion it is not an offense for one to consume such things
God is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Unbelievers do not follow whatever your lying tongues may tell you is lawful or unlawful to invent lies against God
Those who invent lies against God will have no happiness
Such an invention will bring only a little enjoyment but will be followed by painful torment
We had made unlawful for the Jews all that we told you before
We did not do any wrong to them but they wronged themselves
To those who commit sins in their ignorance then repent and reform your Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Abraham was certainly an obedient and upright person
He was not a pagan
He was thankful to God for His bounties
God chose him and guided him to the right path
We granted him virtue in this life and he shall be among the righteous ones in the life to come
We sent you Muhammad a revelation that you should follow the tradition of Abraham the upright one who was not a pagan
The observance of the Sabbath was only sanctioned for those who disputed it
Your Lord will certainly issue His decree about their dispute on the Day of Judgment
Call the pagans to the path of your Lord through wisdom and good advice and argue with them in the best manner
God knows well about those who stray from His path and those who seek guidance
If you want retaliation let it be equal to that which you faced But if you exercise patience it will be better for you
Exercise patience and let it be only for the cause of God
Do not be grieved about them nor disappointed at their evil plans
God is certainly with the pious and the righteous ones
God is the Exalted One who took His servant one night for a visit from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem God has blessed the surroundings of the Aqsa Mosque
He took His servant on this visit to show him miraculous evidence of His existence It is He who is Allhearing and Allaware
To Moses We gave the Book and made it a guide for the children of Israel so that they would not have any one as their guardian other than Me
We made it a guide for the offspring of those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah a thankful servant of God
We made it known to the Israelites through the Torah that they would twice commit evil in the land with great transgression and rebellion
We told them during your first uprising of evil We shall send to you
This is a decree already ordained We then gave you a chance to defeat your enemies with the help of increasing your wealth and offspring
We told you If you do good it will be for your own benefit but if you do bad it will be against your souls When the prophecy of your second transgression will come to pass sadness will cover your faces
They your enemies will enter the mosque as they did the first time to bring about utter destruction
Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you
If you return to disobedience We will also punish you again
We have made hell a prison for the disbelievers
This Quran shows the way to that which is the most upright and gives to the righteous believers the glad news of a great reward
It also declares that for the disbelievers We have prepared a painful torment in the life to come
People pray as earnestly to gain evil as one should to gain virtue But people are hasty
We have made the day and night each as evidence of Our existence
The night is invisible and the day is visible so that you may seek favors from your Lord and determine the number of years and mark the passing of time
For everything We have given a detailed explanation
We have made every person s actions cling to his neck On the Day of Judgment We will bring forth the record of his actions in the form of a wide open book
We will tell him Read it and judge for yourself
One who follows guidance does so for himself and one who goes astray does so against his soul
No one will suffer for the sins of others
We have never punished anyone without sending them Our Messenger first
When We decide to destroy a town We warn the rich ones therein who commit evil
Thus it becomes deserving to destruction and We destroy its very foundations
We have destroyed many generations after the time of Noah
Your Lord is All knowing and Well Aware of the sins of His servants
Whoever desires only the enjoyment of this life will receive it if We want it to be so
Then We will make Hell his reward wherein he will suffer despised and driven away from Our mercy
The effort of one who faithfully strives hard for the happiness of the life to come will be appreciated by God
Each group will receive its share of your Lord s generosity
Your Lord s generosity is not limited
Consider how We have given preference to some people above others yet the life to come has more honor and respect
Do not consider anything equal to God lest you will become despised and neglected
Your Lord has ordained that you must not worship anything other than Him and that you must be kind to your parents
If either or both of your parents should become advanced in age do not express to them words which show your slightest disappointment Never yell at them but always speak to them with kindness
Be humble and merciful towards them and say Lord have mercy upon them as they cherished me in my childhood
Your Lord knows what is in your souls
If you would be righteous know that He is Allforgiving to those who turn to Him in repentance
Give the relatives the destitute and those who when on a journey have become needy their dues
Do not be a wasteful spender Squanderers are the brothers of satan
Satan was faithless to his Lord
If you are not able to assist them at least speak to them in a kind manner
Do not be stingy nor over generous lest you become empty handed and bankrupt
Your Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants
He is Well Aware and watches over His servants
Do not kill your children for fear of poverty
We will give sustenance to all of you
To kill them is certainly a great sin
Do not even approach adultery
It is indecent and an evil act
Do not kill a respectable soul without a just cause
If anyone is wrongfully killed we have given the heirs of that person the right to demand satisfaction or to forgive
He must not exceed the law in having vengeance his victim shall also be assisted by law
Do not get close to the property of the orphans unless it is for a good reason until they are mature and strong Keep your promise you will be questioned about it
While weighing use proper measurements in the exchange of your property
This is fair and will be better in the end
Do not follow what you do not know the ears eyes and hearts will all be held responsible for their deeds
Do not walk proudly on the earth your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains
All such things are sins and detestable in the sight of your Lord
Muhammad these are words of wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you
Do not consider anything equal to God lest you be thrown into hell despised and driven away from God s mercy
Pagans has your Lord given you preference over Himself by granting you sons and taking the angels as His own daughters
What you say is a monstrous utterance
We have given you various facts about the Truth in this Quran so that they unbelievers would take heed but this has only increased their aversion to the truth
Muhammad ask them Had there been many other gods besides Him as they say they should have found a way to the Lord of the Throne
God is too Glorious and Exalted to be considered as they believe Him to be He is the most High and Great
The seven heavens the earth and whatever is between them all glorify Him
There is nothing that does not glorify Him and always praise him but you do not understand their praise and glorification
He is Allforbearing and Allforgiving
When you recite the Quran We place a curtain as a barrier between you and those who do not believe in the life to come
We put a veil over their hearts so that they cannot understand it We deafen their ears
When you mention your Lord in this Quran as One Supreme Being they run away
We know what they want to hear when they listen to you They whisper to each other and say You are only following a bewitched person
Consider what they have called you
They have certainly gone astray and cannot find the right path
The pagans say When we become mere bones and dust shall we then be brought back to life again
Muhammad say Yes even if you become rocks iron
or anything that you think is harder to be brought to life
They will soon ask Who will bring us back to life
Say The One who created you in the first place
They will shake their heads and say When will He bring us back to life
Say Perhaps very soon
On the day when He will call you you will answer Him with praise and think that you have tarried for only a little while
Muhammad tell My servants to say what is best
Satan sows dissension among them he is the sworn enemy of human beings
Your Lord knows better than you people
He will have mercy on you or will punish you as He wills
We have not sent you to watch over them
Your Lord knows best about those in the heavens and the earth
We have given preference to some Prophets over others and We gave the psalms to David
Muhammad tell them Seek help from those whom you consider equal to God
They are not able to remove or change your hardships
Those whom they worship seek to find intercessors for themselves with God They try to find out which of the intercessors are closer to God
They have hope for His mercy and fear of His punishment the punishment of your Lord is awesome
The decree that all the towns were to be destroyed or afflicted with severe punishment was already written in the Book before the Day of Judgment
We did not abstain from sending miracles to any of Our Messengers These miracles were called lies by the people who lived in ancient times
To the people of Thamud We sent the shecamel as a visible miracle and they did injustice to it
We only send miracles as warnings
Muhammad We told you that your Lord has encompassed all mankind
We made the vision which We showed you and the condemned tree mentioned in the Quran as a trial for the human being
Even though We warn them it only increases their rebellion
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis who said Should I prostrate before one whom You have created out of clay
He continued Remember this one whom you have honored more than me I shall bring him and most of his offspring under my sway if you will give me respite until the Day of Judgment
God said Go away
All those who follow you will have hell as ample recompense for their deeds
Draw anyone of them you can into sin by your voice and by your cavalry and infantry share their property and children with them and make promises to them
Your promises are all lies
You have no authority over My servants
Your Lord is a Sufficient Protector
Your Lord who causes the ships to sail on the sea so that you may seek His bounty is certainly Allmerciful to you
If you are afflicted by hardships in the middle of the sea it would be an error to call anyone other than Him for help
When God saves you from such difficulties you turn away from Him
The human being has always been ungrateful
Do you feel secure that We will not cause a part of the land to sink or engulf you with sand storms when you would find no one to protect you
Do you feel secure that We will not drive you back to the sea send a fierce gale to you and cause you to drown because of your disbelief when you would not be able to find anyone who would intercede for you with Us
We have honored the children of Adam carried them on the land and the sea given them pure sustenance and exalted them above most of My creatures
On the day when We call every nation with their leaders those whose record of deeds are given to their right hands will read the book and the least wrong will not be done to them
Those who are blind in this life will also be blind in the life to come and in terrible error
Such blind ones try to confuse what We have revealed to you so that they may falsely ascribe to Us something other than the true revelation and thus establish friendship with you
Had We not strengthened your faith you might have relied on them some how
Had you done so We would certainly have made you face double punishment in this life and after your death and you would have found none to help you
They try to annoy you so that they can expel you from the land
Had they been successful no one would have been left behind except a few
This was Our tradition with Our Messengers who lived before you and you will find no change in Our tradition
Say your prayer when the sun declines until the darkness of night and also at dawn
Dawn is certainly witnessed by the angels of the night and day
Say your special tahajjud prayer during some part of the night as an additional obligatory prayer for you alone so that perhaps your Lord will raise you to a highly praiseworthy position
Muhammad say Lord make me enter through a path that will lead to the Truth and come out of an exit that will take me to the Truth
Give me helpful authority
Say Truth has come and falsehood has been banished it is doomed to banishment
We reveal the Quran which is a cure and mercy for the believers but does nothing for the unjust except to lead them to perdition
When We do favors to the human being he disregards it and turns away from it
When evil afflicts him he becomes despairing
Say Everyone does as he wants
Your Lord knows best who has the right guidance
They ask you about the Spirit
Say The Spirit comes by the command of my Lord
You have been given very little knowledge
Had We wanted We could have removed the Spirit through whom We sent you revelation
Then you would not have found anyone to intercede with Us for you
except by the mercy of your Lord
He has certainly bestowed great favors on you
Say If all human beings and jinn were to come together to bring the equivalent of this Quran they could not do so even if they all were to help each other
We have mentioned in this Quran all kinds of examples for the human being but most human beings turn away in disbelief
They have said We shall never believe you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth
or you show us that you have your own garden of palm trees and vines with flowing streams therein
or cause the sky to fall into pieces on us as you believe you can or bring God and the angels face to face with us
or show us that you have a well adorned house of your own or climb into the sky
We shall never believe that you have climbed into the sky until you bring us a book that we can read
Say All glory belongs to my Lord
Am I more than a mortal Messenger
What keeps people from belief that guidance has come to them but they question Why has God sent a mortal Messenger
Muhammad say Had the earth been inhabited by angels who would walk serenely therein only then would We have sent to them angelic Messengers
Say God is a sufficient Witness between me and you
He certainly sees and knows all about His servants
Whomever God has guided has the proper guidance
You will never find any guardian besides God for the one whom He has caused to go astray
On the Day of Judgment We will gather them lying on their faces blind dumb and deaf
Hell will be their dwelling
As hell fire abates We will increase its blazing force
This will be the recompense for their disbelief of Our revelations and for their saying Shall we be brought to life again after becoming bones and dust
Do they not realize that God who has created the heavens and the earth has the power to create their like
He has given them life for an appointed time of which there is no doubt
The unjust turn away in disbelief from Our revelation
Say Had you owned the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord you would have locked them up for fear of spending them
The human being has always been stingy
To Moses We gave nine illustrious miracles Ask the Israelites Moses came to them
The Pharaoh said to him Moses I believe that you are bewitched
He replied Certainly you have come to know that these have been sent by the Lord of the heavens and the earth as lessons to people
Pharaoh I believe that you are doomed to perdition
The Pharaoh wanted to expel the Israelites from the land so We drowned him and all who were with him
We told the Israelites after this to settle in the land until Our second promise will come true We would then gather them all together on the Day of Judgment
We sent it the Quran in all Truth and in all Truth it came
Muhammad We have sent you for no other reason than to be a bearer of glad news and a warner
We have divided the Quran into many segments so that you would read them to the people in gradual steps as We reveal them to you from time to time
Say It does not matter whether you believe in it or not for when it is read to those who had received the knowledge heavenly Books that were sent before they bow down and prostrate themselves before the Lord
They say Our Lord is too Glorious to disregard His promise
They bow down in prostration and weep and it makes them more humble before the Lord
Muhammad tell them It is all the same whether you call Him God or the Beneficent
All the good names belong to Him
Muhammad do not be too loud or slow in your prayer
Choose a moderate way of praying
Say It is only God who deserves all praise He has not begotten a son and has no partner in His Kingdom
He does not need any guardian to help Him in His need Proclaim His greatness
Praise be to God He has sent the Book to His servant and has made it a flawless guide for human beings
so that he could warn them of His stern retribution give the glad news of the best and everlasting reward to the righteously striving believers
wherein they shall remain forever
and admonish those who say that God has begotten a son
Neither they nor their fathers had any knowledge of such utterance that God has begotten a son
Whatever they say about this matter is vicious blasphemy and plain lies
Perhaps you will destroy yourself out of grief because they disbelieve this Book
We have caused earthly things to seem attractive so that We can see who will excel in good deeds
Let it be known that We will turn all things on earth into dust
Do you not think that the story of the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription was one of Our marvelous miracles
When the youth sought refuge in the cave they prayed Lord grant us mercy and help us to get out of this trouble in a righteous way
We sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years
Then We roused them to find out which of the party had the correct account of the duration of their sleep in the cave
We tell you this story for a genuine purpose
They were young people who believed in their Lord and We gave them further guidance
We strengthened their hearts when they stood up against the idols and said Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
We shall never worship anyone other than Him lest we commit blasphemy
Our people have considered other things equal to God
Why cannot they present clear proof in support of their claim
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God
They were told Now that you have abandoned them and what they worship instead of God seek refuge in the cave God will certainly grant you mercy and provide you with help to safely get out of this trouble
No sunlight could reach them during their sleep in the cave One could see the rising sun decline to the right of their cave and the setting sun move its way to the left whilst they were sleeping in an opening of the cave
This is one of the miracles of God
Whomever God guides receives the right guidance and you will never find a guardian or guide for those whom He causes to go astray
One would think them the youths awake while in fact they were sleeping
We turned their bodies from right to left and their dog stretched its front legs on the ground
Had one looked them over he would have run away from them in terror
We roused them from their sleep so that they would question each other about their stay in the cave
One of them said How long do you think we have stayed here
They replied A day or part of a day
They added Your Lord knows better how long we have stayed here
Let us send one of us with this money to the city to get some pure food so that we might eat
He should be careful so that no one will know about us If they were to recognize us
they would certainly stone us to death or force us to follow their religion
Then we shall never be able to have everlasting happiness
We caused their story to become public so that people would know that God s promise was true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Day of Judgment
They started to argue with each other about the matter Resurrection and some of them said Let us establish a building at the youths sleeping place to hide them
Their Lord knew best their intentions about them
The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place
With regard to the number of the youths some say There were three and the dog was the fourth one Others say There were five and the dog was the sixth one
In reality they are just feeling around in the dark
Still some of them say There were seven and the dog was the eighth one
Muhammad say My Lord has the best knowledge of their number
You know very little about it
Do not insist on arguing with them but merely tell them the story as it has been revealed to you and do not ask anyone about them
Never say of something I shall do it tomorrow
without adding if God wills
Recall your Lord if you forget to do something Say I hope that my Lord will provide me better guidance
They in fact stayed in the cave for three hundred plus nine further years
Muhammad say God knows best how long they stayed there to Him belongs the unseen of both the heavens and the earth How clear is His sight and how keen His hearing No one other than Him is their guardian and no one shares His Judgment
Read whatever is revealed to you from the Book of your Lord
No one can change His words and you can never find any refuge other than Him
Be patient with those who worship their Lord in the mornings and evenings to seek His pleasure
Do not overlook them to seek the worldly pleasures
Do not obey those whom We have caused to neglect Us and instead follow their own desires beyond all limits
Say Truth comes from your Lord
Let people have faith or disbelieve as they chose
For the unjust We have prepared a fire which will engulf them with its flames
Whenever they cry for help they will be answered with water as hot as molted brass which will scald their faces
How terrible is such a drink and such a resting place
The righteously striving believers should know that We do not neglect the reward of those who do good deeds
They will be admitted to the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow
They will rest on soft couches decked with bracelets of gold and clothed in green silk garments and shining brocade
How blissful is such a reward and resting place
Muhammad tell them the parable of the two men
To one of them We had given two gardens of vines surrounded by the palm trees with a piece of farm land between them
and a stream flowing through the middle of the gardens
Both gardens would yield fruits to their fullest capacity
Whatever was produced belonged to him To his friend he exclaimed I have more wealth and greater manpower than you
He unjustly entered his garden and said I do not think this property will ever perish
nor do I think that there will be a Day of Judgment
Even if I shall be brought before my Lord I certainly deserve to have a better place than this
His friend said to him How can you disbelieve in the One who turned clay into sperm out of which He created you
I believe that He is God my Lord and I do not consider anything equal to Him
When entering your garden you should have said This is what God willed All Power belongs to Him
Even if you consider me inferior to yourself in wealth and offspring
perhaps my Lord will give me a garden better than yours and strike your garden with a thunderbolt from the sky to turn it into a barren ground
or cause the streams in your garden to disappear under the ground such that you will never be able to find them
Sure enough the rich person s fruits were all destroyed and he began to wring his hands in grief for all that he had invested in his garden
He found his garden tumbled to its trellises and said Would that I had not considered anything equal to my Lord
He had no one besides God to help him nor could he himself achieve any success
In such helplessness the human being realizes that it is God who is the true Guardian and His rewards and recompense are the best
Muhammad tell them The worldly life resembles the seasonal plants that blossom by the help of the water which God sends from the sky
After a short time all of them fade away and the winds scatter them and turns them into dust
God has power over all things
Children and property are the ornaments of the worldly life but for deeds which continually produce virtue one can obtain better rewards from God and have greater hope in Him
On the day when We will cause the mountains to travel around and the earth to turn into a levelled plain We will also bring all human beings together No one will be left behind
They will all be lined up in the presence of your Lord who will tell them Despite your belief that there would never be a Day of Judgment all of you are brought in Our presence just as though We had created you for the first time
You believed that our promise could never come true
When the record of every one s deeds is placed before him you will see the criminals terrified from what the record contains
They will say Woe to us
What kind of record is this that has missed nothing small or great
They will find whatever they have done right before their very eyes
Your Lord is not unjust to any one
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis
He was a jinn and he sinned against the command of his Lord
Why do you people obey him and his offspring instead of Me even though they are your enemies
How terrible will be the recompense that the wrong doers will receive
I did not call the unjust to witness the creation of the heavens and earth nor to witness their own creation nor did I want to be helped by those who lead people astray
On the day when God asks the idolators to seek help from their idols they will call their idols for help
But the idols will not answer them We shall separate the two parties from each other by a destructive gulf
When the criminals see hell fire they will have no doubt about falling headlong therein nor of finding anyone to save them
We have given various examples in this Quran for people to learn a lesson but the human being is the most contentious creature
What prevents people from having faith when guidance comes to them or from asking for forgiveness from their Lord before they face the kind of torment that the ancient people experienced or a new form of torment
The only reason for Our sending the Messengers is to give the human being the glad news of Our mercy and to warn him about Our wrath
The disbelievers argue by false means to refute the Truth
They mock My miracles and warnings
Who are more unjust than those who are reminded of the revelations of their Lord but have disregarded them and have forgotten their deeds
We have veiled their hearts and sealed their ears so that they cannot understand
Even if you call them to the right path they will never accept guidance
Your Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Had He wanted to punish them for their sins He would have been prompt to torment them
For their punishment there is an appointed time after which there will be no way for them to escape
We only destroyed the inhabitants of certain towns when they had committed injustice and did not repent before Our deadline
Consider when Moses said to his young companion I shall continue travelling until I reach the junction of the two seas or have travelled for many years
When they reached the junction of the two seas they found out that they had forgotten all about the fish which they had carried for food The fish found its way into the sea
Moses asked his young companion when they crossed this point Bring us our food the journey has made us tired
His companion replied Do you remember the rock on which we took rest
Satan made me forget to mention to you the story of the fish and how it miraculously made its way into the sea
Moses said That is exactly what we are seeking They followed their own foot prints back to the rock
There they met one of Our servants who had received blessings and knowledge from Us
Moses asked him Can I follow you so that you would teach me the guidance that you have received
He replied You will not be able to have patience with me
How can you remain patient with that which you do not fully understand
Moses said If God wishes you will find me patient and I shall not disobey any of your orders
He said to Moses If you will follow me do not ask me about anything until I tell you the story about it
They started their journey and some time latter they embarked in a boat in which he made a hole
Moses asked him Did you make the hole to drown the people on board
This is certainly very strange
He said Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me
Moses said Please forgive my forgetfulness Do not oblige me with what is difficult for me to endure
They continued on their journey until they met a young boy whom he killed
Moses said How could you murder an innocent soul
This is certainly a horrible act
He responded Did I not tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me
Moses said If I ask you such questions again abandon me you will have enough reason to do so
They continued on their journey again until they reached a town
They asked the people there for food but no one accepted them as their guests
They found there a wall of a house which was on the verge of tumbling to the ground
The companion of Moses repaired that wall
Moses said You should have received some money for your labor
He replied This is where we should depart from one another
I shall give an explanation to you for all that I have done for which you could not remain patient
The boat belonged to some destitute people who were using it as a means of their living in the sea
The king had imposed a certain amount of tax on every undamaged boat I damaged it so that they would not have to pay the tax
The young boy had very faithful parents
We were afraid that out of love for him they would lose their faith in God and commit rebellion
so We decided that their Lord should replace him by a better and more virtuous son
The tumbling wall belonged to two orphans in the town whose father was a righteous person
Underneath the wall there was a treasure that belonged to them
Your Lord wanted the orphans to find the treasure through the mercy of your Lord when they mature
I did not repair the wall out of my own desire
These were the explanations of my deeds about which you could not remain patient
Muhammad they will ask you about Dhu lQarnayn
Say I shall tell you something about him
We had given him great power in the land and all kinds of resources
With these he traveled
to the West where he found the sun setting into a warm source spring of water and a people living near by
We asked him Dhu lQarnayn you may punish them or treat them with kindness
He replied I shall punish the unjust ones among them and then they will return to their Lord who will punish them more sternly
As for those who believe and do good they will receive virtuous rewards and We will tell them to do only what they can
He travelled again
to the East where he found the sun rising upon a people whom We had exposed to its rays
This indeed was true
We knew all that he did there
He travelled
after this to the middle of two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand a single word
They said Dhu lQarnayn Gog and Magog are ravaging this land
Would you establish a barrier between us and them if we pay you a certain tax
He replied The power that my Lord has granted me is better than your tax
Help me with your manpower and I shall construct a barrier between you and Gog and Magog
Bring me blocks of iron to fill up the passage between the two mountains
He told them to ply their bellows until the iron became hot as fire
Then he told them to pour on it molten brass
Thus he constructed the barrier which neither Gog nor Magog were able to climb nor were they able to dig a tunnel through the iron and brass barrier
Dhu lQarnayn said This barrier is a blessing from my Lord but when His promise comes to pass He will level it to the ground His promise always comes true
On the day when the barrier is demolished We will leave human beings in chaos
We will leave them like the waves of the sea striking against each other
Then the trumpet will be sounded and We will bring them all together
We will fully expose the view of hell on that Day to the disbelievers
whose eyes had been veiled against Our Quran and who were not able to hear its recitation
Do the unbelievers think they can make My servants as their guardians instead of Me
We have prepared hell as a dwelling place for the disbelievers
Muhammad tell them Should I tell you who will face the greatest loss as a result of their deeds
It will be those who labor a great deal in this life but without guidance yet think that they are doing a great many good deeds
They have rejected the revelations of their Lord and their meeting with Him Thus their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and will be of no value on the Day of Judgment
For their disbelief and their mocking Our revelations and Messengerss their recompense will be hell
The righteously striving believers will have the gardens of Paradise as their dwelling place and therein they will live forever
without any desire to change their abode
Muhammad tell them Had the seas been used as ink to write down the words of my Lord they would have all been consumed before the words of my Lord could have been recorded even though replenished with a like quantity of ink
Say I am only a mortal like you but I have received revelation that there is only one Lord
Whoever desires to meet his Lord should strive righteously and should worship no one besides Him
Ain Sad
This is the story of the blessing of your Lord to His servant Zachariah
When he quietly called his Lord
and said My Lord my bones have become feeble and my hair has turned white with age Yet I have never been deprived in receiving from You the answer to my prayers
I am afraid of what my kinsmen will do after my death and my wife is barren
Lord grant me a son
who will be my heir and the heir of the family of Jacob
Lord make him a person who will please you
We answered his prayers with the glad news of the birth of a son by the name of John and told him We have never given such a name to anyone else
He said Lord how can I have a son
My wife is barren and I have reached an extremely old age
The angel said This is true but your Lord says For Me it is easy I created you when you did not exist
Zachariah asked Lord show me evidence if this is a heavenly news
The Lord said The evidence for it is that you must not speak to any mortal though you are in good health for three nights and days
Zachariah came out to his people from place of worship and inspired them to glorify the Lord both in the morning and evening
We commanded John Zachariah s son to follow the guidance of the Lord with due steadfastness
To John We gave knowledge and wisdom to John during his childhood
We gave him compassion and purity
He was a pious human being
kind to his parents not arrogant or a rebellious person
He was born and died in peace and will be brought back to life again in peace
Muhammad mention in the Book the Quran the story of Mary how she left her family and started living in a solitary place to the East
out of her people s sight
We sent Our Spirit to her who stood before her in the shape of a well formed human being
Mary said Would that the Beneficent God would protect me from you
Leave me alone if you are a God fearing person
He said I am the Messengers of your Lord I have come to give you a purified son
She said How can I have a son when no mortal has touched me nor am I an unchaste woman
He said This is true but your Lord says It is very easy for Me
We have decided to give you a son as evidence of Our existence for human beings and a mercy from Us
This is a decree already ordained
She conceived the child and retreated with him to a distant and solitary place
When she started to experience the pain of of childbirth labor by the trunk of a palm tree in sadness she said Would that I had died long before and passed into oblivion
Then she heard the baby saying Do not be sad Your Lord has caused a stream to run at your feet
If you shake the trunk of the palm tree it will provide you with fresh ripe dates
Eat drink and rejoice
Should you see a person going by tell him that on this day you have promised the Beneficent God to fast and never talk to any human being
She took him to her people and they said Mary this is indeed an strange thing
Aaron s sister your father was not a bad man nor was your mother unchaste
She pointed to the baby and referred them to him for their answer
They said How can we talk to a baby in the cradle
He said I am the servant of God
He has given me the Book and has appointed me to be a Prophet
He has blessed me no matter where I dwell commanded me to worship Him and pay the religious tax for as long as I live
He has commanded me to be good to my parents and has not made me an arrogant rebellious person
I was born with peace and I shall die and be brought to life again with peace
Such was the true story of Jesus the son of Mary about which they dispute bitterly
God is too Exalted to have a son
When He decides to bring some thing into existence He needs only command it to exist and it comes into existence
Baby Jesus said Worship God who is my Lord as well as yours
This is the straight path
The followers of Jesus turned themselves into quarrelling sects
The disbelievers shall face a woeful condition on the great Day of Judgment
Muhammad how clearly they will hear and see on the day when they will be brought into Our presence
Today the wrong doers are in manifest error
Warn them of the woeful day when the final decree will be issued they are neglectful and faithless
We are the heirs of the earth and those living in it will all return to Us
Mention the story of Abraham the truthful Prophet in the Book the Quran
who asked his father Father why do you worship something that can neither hear nor see nor help you at all
Father I have received the knowledge which has not been given to you
Follow me I shall guide you to the right path
Father do not worship satan he has disobeyed the Beneficent God
Father I am afraid that the Beneficent God s torment will strike you and you will become a friend of satan
His father replied Abraham are you telling me to giveup my gods
If you will not stop this I shall stone you to death
Leave my house and do not come back again
Abraham said Peace be with you I shall ask my Lord to forgive you He has been gracious to me
I shall stay away from you and what you worship instead of God
I worship my Lord and hope that my prayers will not be ignored
When Abraham rejected his people and what they worshipped instead of God We gave him Isaac and Jacob and made both of them Prophets
We granted them Our blessing and high renown
Muhammad mention in the Book the Quran the story of Moses
Moses was a sincere person a Messengers and a Prophet
We called him from the right side of Mount Sinai and drew him close for communication
Out of Our mercy We gave him his brother Aaron who himself was a Prophet
Mention in the Book the Quran the story of Ishmael he was true to his promise a Messengers and a Prophet
He would order his people to worship God and pay the religious tax
His Lord was pleased with him
Mention in the Book the Quran the story of Idris Enoch he was a truthful Prophet
We granted him a high position
These were the Prophets from the offspring of Adam from those who embarked with Noah and from the offspring of Abraham and Israel
God guided them and chose them for His favor
Whenever they would hear the revelations of the Beneficent God they would bow down in prostration with tears
They were succeeded by a generation who neglected their prayers and followed their worldly desires
They will certainly be lost
but those among them who repent and become righteously striving believers will be admitted to the gardens without experiencing any injustice
They will be admitted to the garden of Eden which is the unseen promise of the Beneficent God to His servants
The promise of God will certainly come true
They will not hear therein any meaningless words They will be greeted by the angels with Peace be with you and they will receive their sustenance both in the mornings and evenings
Such are the gardens which We will give to Our Godfearing servants as their inherited property
Muhammad we the angels do not come to you without being commanded by your Lord to do so To Him belongs all that is before us behind us and in between Your Lord is not forgetful
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
Worship Him and be steadfast in your worship of Him none is equal to Him
The human being says Shall I be brought to life again after I will die
Does he not remember that We created him when he did not exist
By your Lord We will bring them back to life with satan and gather them around hell in large groups
Then We will separate from every group those who were strongly rebellious against the Beneficent God
We know best who deserves greater suffering in hell fire
It is the inevitable decree of your Lord that every one of you will be taken to hell
We will save the pious ones from the hell fire and leave the unjust people therein in crowded groups
When Our revelations are recited to them the unbelievers say to the faithful ones Which of us is more prosperous
How many generations of greater prosperity and splendor have We destroyed before them
Muhammad tell them The Beneficent God gives respite to those who have gone astray only until they face the torment with which they were threatened or to the Day of Judgment
Then they will find out who will have the most miserable place and the weakest forces
God further enlightens those who seek guidance
To those who do charitable deeds which produce continuing benefits your Lord will give a better reward and a better place in Paradise
Note the words of the disbeliever I shall certainly be given wealth and children
Has he the knowledge of the unseen or has the Beneficent God established such a binding agreement with Him
Absolutely not We will record his words and prolong his punishment
All that he speaks of will belong to Us and he will come into Our presence all alone
They have sought honor from other gods instead of God
In fact they can have no honor their gods will renounce their worship of idols and will turn against them
Do you not realize that We have sent Satan to incite the unbelievers to sin
Muhammad exercise patience We have given them respite only for an appointed time
On the Day of Judgment when the pious people will be brought into the presence of the Beneficent God as the guests of honor
and the criminals will be driven and thrown into hell
no one will be able to intercede for the others except those whom the Beneficent God has given authority
They have said that the Beneficent God has given birth to a son
This is certainly a monstrous lie
This would almost cause the heavens to rent apart the earth to cleave asunder and the mountains to crumble down in fragments
to ascribe a son to the Beneficent God
The Beneficent God is too Exalted to have a son
All that is in the heavens and the earth will return to the Beneficent God as His submissive servants
He has counted and enumerated them one by one
Everyone on the Day of Judgment will individually come into the presence of God
To the righteously striving believers God will grant love
Muhammad We have given you the Book the Quran in your own language so that you could easily give the glad news to the pious ones and warn the quarrelsome ones
How many generations living before them did We destroy
Do you find anyone of them around or do you even hear any word from them
Ta Ha
We have sent the Quran only as reminder
for those who have fear of disobeying God not to make you Muhammad miserable
It is a revelation from the Creator of the earth and the high heavens
The Beneficent God is dominant over the Throne of the realm
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth all that lies between them and lies below the earth
Whether or not you express your thoughts in words God certainly knows all unspoken thoughts and all that is even more difficult to find
God is the only Lord and to Him belong all the exalted Names
Muhammad have you heard the story of Moses
When he saw the fire he said to his family Wait here for I can see a fire Perhaps I shall bring you a burning torch or find a way to some fire
When he came near the fire he was called Moses
I Am your Lord
Take off your shoes you are in the holy valley of Tuwa
I have chosen you as My Messengers
Listen to the revelation
I Am the only God
Worship Me and be steadfast in prayer to have My name always in your mind
Although it is certain that the Day of Judgment will come I prefer to keep it almost a secret so that every soul will receive the recompense for what it has done on its own
Let not the unbelievers who follow their vain desires make you forget the Day of Judgment lest you will perish
The Lord asked Moses what is in your right hand
He replied It is my staff
I lean on it bring down leaves for my sheep with it and I need it for other reasons
The Lord said Moses throw it on the ground
Moses threw it on the ground and suddenly he saw that it was a moving serpent
The Lord said Hold the serpent and do not be afraid We will bring it back to its original form
Now as another Sign place your hand under your arm and it will come out sheer white without harm or stain
This We have done to show you some of Our greater miracles
Go to the Pharaoh he has become a rebel
Moses said Lord grant me courage
Make my task easy
and my tongue fluent
so that they may understand me
Appoint a deputy for me from my own people
Let it be my brother Aaron
to support me
Let him be my partner in this task
so that we may glorify
and remember you often
You are Well Aware of our situation
The Lord said Moses your request is granted
It is the second time that We have bestowed upon you Our favor
Remember when We inspired your mother with a certain inspiration
to lace her child in a chest and throw it into the sea which would hurl it towards the shore
Then an enemy of Mine who was also the enemy of the child would pick it up from there
I made you attractive and loveable so that you would be reared before My own eyes
Your sister went to them and said May I show you someone who will nurse this child
We returned you to your mother to make her rejoice and forget her grief
You slew a man and We saved you from trouble
We tried you through various trials
Then you stayed some years with the people of Midian Shu ayb and his family and after that you came back to Egypt as was ordained
I chose you for Myself
Go with your brother Take My miracles and do not be reluctant in preaching My message
Go both of you to the Pharaoh he has become a rebel
Both of you must speak with him in a gentle manner so that perhaps he may come to himself or have fear of God
They said Lord we are afraid of his transgression and rebellion against us
The Lord replied them Do not be afraid I Am with you all the time listening and seeing
They came to the Pharaoh and told him that they were the Messengerss of his Lord and that they wanted him to let the Israelites go with them and stop afflicting the Israelites with torment
They told the Pharaoh We have brought miracles from Our Creator
Peace be with those who follow the right guidance
It is revealed to us that those who call our message a lie or turn away from it will face the torment
The Pharaoh asked them Who is your Lord
They replied Our Lord is the One Who has created all things and has given guidance
He then asked What do you know about the past generations
Moses replied The knowledge about it is with my Lord in the Book
My Lord is free from error and forgetfulness
It is God who has made the earth as a cradle for you with roads for you to travel
He has sent water from the sky to produce various pairs of plants
Consume them as food or for grazing your cattle
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people of reason
We have created you from the earth to which We will return you and will bring you back to life again
We showed the Pharaoh all of Our miracles but he called them lies and turned away from them
He said to Moses Have you come to expel us from our land through your magic
We shall also answer you by magic Let us make an appointment for a contest among us and let each of us be present at a certain time in the appointed place
Moses said Let the contest take place on the Day of Feast so that all the people can come together during the brightness of the day
The Pharaoh returned to organize his plans and then attended the appointment
Moses told them the magicians Woe to you if you invent falsehood against God you will be destroyed by the torment
Whoever invents falsehood against God will certainly be lost
They started arguing and whispering to each other
and said These two people are magicians
They want to expel you from your land through their magic and to destroy your own tradition
Bring together your devices and come forward in ranks the winner will certainly have great happiness
They said Moses would you be the first to show your skill or should we be the first to throw down our devices
Moses said You throw first
When they did their ropes and staffs through their magic seemed to be moving
Moses felt afraid within himself
We told him Do not be afraid for you will be the winner
Throw down what is in your right hand and it will swallow up all that they have performed theirs is only a magical performance
Magicians can find no happiness in whatever they do
The magicians bowed down in prostration saying We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said Since you believed in him without my permission then Moses certainly must be your chief who has taught you magic
I shall cut your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunk of the palmtree
You shall certainly find which among us can afflict a more severe and lasting punishment
They the magicians said We would never prefer you to the miracles that we have seen or to our Creator
Do what you want
This life is only for a short time
We have faith in our Lord so that He will forgive our sins and our magical performances that you forced us to show God is better than all things and His rewards last longer
The dwelling place of one who comes into the presence of his Lord as a criminal will be hell wherein he will never die nor enjoy his life
One who comes into the presence of his Lord with faith and righteous deeds
will be rewarded by high status in the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow
Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves
We sent revelations to Moses telling him Travel with My servants during the night and strike a dry road across the sea for them
Have no fear of being overtaken by the Pharaoh nor of anything else
The Pharaoh and his army chased Moses and his people but were drowned by the sea
The Pharaoh and his people had gone away from guidance
Children of Israel We saved you from your enemy and promised to settle you on the right side of the peaceful Mount Tur Sinai
and We sent you manna and quails
I allowed you to consume the pure sustenance which We had given you but not to become rebels lest you become subject to My wrath Whoever becomes subject to My wrath will certainly be destroyed
The Lord asked Moses what made you attend your appointment with Me before your people
Moses replied They are just behind me
I came earlier to seek Your pleasure
The Lord said We tested your people after you left them and the Samiri made them go astray
Moses sad and angry returned to his people saying My people did not the Lord make you a gracious promise
Why did you disregard your appointment with me
Was it because of the long time or did you want to become subject to the wrath of your Lord
They replied We did not go against our promise with you out of our own accord
We were forced to carry people s ornaments
We threw them away and so did the Samiri
Then the Samiri forged the body of a motionless calf which gave out a hollow sound The people said This is your Lord and the Lord of Moses whom he Moses forgot to mention
Did they not consider that the calf could not give them any answer nor it could harm or benefit them
Aaron had told them before My people you are deceived by the calf
Your Lord is the Beneficent God
Follow me and obey my orders
They said We shall continue worshipping the calf until Moses comes back
Then Moses asked Aaron What made you not follow me when you saw them in error
Did you disobey my orders
Aaron replied Son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or head
I was afraid that you might consider me responsible for causing discord among the children of Israel and would not pay attention to my words
Moses asked Samiri what were your motives
He replied I had the skill of carving which they did not have
I followed some of the Messengers s Moses tradition but I then ignored it
Thus my soul prompted me to carve a golden calf with an artificial hollow sound
Moses said Go away
Throughout your life you will not be able to let anyone touch you
This will be your punishment in this life
The time for your final punishment is inevitable
You will never be able to avoid it
Look at your god which you have been worshipping
We will burn it in the fire and scatter its ashes into the sea
Your Lord is the One who is the only God and He has the knowledge of all things
Thus We tell you Muhammad the stories of the past and We have given you the Quran
Whoever disregards the Quran will be heavily burdened with sin on the Day of Judgment
with which he will live forever On the Day of Judgment it will be a terrible load for him to carry
On the day when the trumpet will be sounded We will raise the criminals from their graves and their eyes will be turned blue and blind
They will slowly talk to each other and say Our life on earth was as short as ten days
We know best what they say
The moderate ones among them will say You did not live on earth for more than a day
Muhammad they will ask you about the mountains
Tell them My Lord will grind them to powder
and leave them so smoothly levelled
that you will see no depression or elevation in it
On that day they will follow their caller without deviation Their voices will be low in the presence of the Beneficent God
You will hear nothing but the tread of the marching feet
On that day no one s intercession will be of any benefit unless he has received permission from the Beneficent God and whose word is acceptable to Him
God knows all that is in front of them and behind them and they can not encompass His knowledge
Faces will be humble before the Everlasting and the Selfexisting God
Despair will strike those who are loaded with the burden of injustice
The righteously striving believers should have no fear of being treated with injustice or inequity
We have revealed the Quran in the Arabic language containing various warnings so that it may cause them to have fear of God or take heed
God is the Most High and the True King
Muhammad do not be hasty in reading the Quran to the people before the revelation has been completed
Say My Lord grant me more knowledge
We had commanded Adam certain matters
He forgot Our commandment and We did not find in him the determination to fulfil Our commandments
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis satan who refused
We said Adam this satan is your enemy and the enemy of your spouse
Let him not expel you and your spouse from Paradise lest you plunge into misery
In Paradise you will experience no hunger nakedness
thirst or exposure to the hot Sun
Satan trying to seduce him said Adam do you want me to show you the Tree of Eternity and the Everlasting Kingdom
Adam and his wife ate fruits from the tree and found themselves naked
Then they started to cover themselves with the leaves from the garden
Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray
His Lord forgave him accepted his repentance and gave him guidance
God then told them Get out of here all of you you are each other s enemies
When My guidance comes to you those who follow it will not go astray nor will they endure any misery
Whoever ignores My guidance will live a woeful life and will be brought in Our presence blind on the Day of Judgment
He will say My Lord why have you brought me back to life blind before I could see
The Lord will say This is true But just as you forgot Our revelations that had come to you so too are you forgotten on this day
Thus We recompense those who are unjust and have no faith in Our revelations
The torment in the life to come will be more severe and last longer
Is it not a warning for them to see how many generations living before them We destroyed and how they are now walking in their ruins
In this there is the evidence of the Truth for the people of reason
Had not the word of your Lord been decreed otherwise the unbelievers deserved immediate punishment The appointed time for their punishment will inevitably come
Muhammad have patience with what they say glorify your Lord and always praise Him before sunrise sunset in some hours of the night and at both the beginning and end of the day so that perhaps you will please your Lord
Do not be envious of what We have given to some people as means of enjoyment and worldly delight
Such means are a trial for them but the reward that you will receive from your Lord will be far better and everlasting
Instruct your family to pray and to be steadfast in their worship
We do not ask any sustenance from you it is We who give you sustenance
Know that piety will have a happy end
They have said Why has he Muhammad not brought some miracle from his Lord
Have they not received the previously revealed heavenly Books as the evidence of the Truth
Had We destroyed them with a torment before the coming of Muhammad they would have said Lord would that you had sent us a Messengers so that we could have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and disgraced
Muhammad tell them Everyone is waiting
Wait and you shall know very soon who will be the followers of the right path with the right guidance
The people s day of reckoning is drawing closer yet they are heedlessly neglectful
Whenever a new revelation comes to them from their Lord they listen to it in a playful manner
and their hearts are preoccupied with trivial matters
The unjust ones whisper to each other and say Is he Muhammad more than a mere mortal like you
How can you follow that which you know is only a magic
The Lord said Tell them Muhammad My Lord knows all that is said in the heavens and the earth
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
They have said It the Quran is only the result of some confused dreams
He is only a poet He should show us some miracles as the ancient Prophets had done
The people of the town whom We had destroyed also had no faith
Will these people then believe in God
The messengers that We had sent before you were only men to whom We had given revelation
Ask the People of the Book if you do not know
We had not made them such bodies that would not eat any food nor were they immortal
Our promise to them came true and We saved them and those whom We wanted but destroyed the unjust people
We have sent a Book the Quran which is an honor for you
Will you then not understand
How many unjust towns did We destroy and replace them with other nations
When they found Our torment approaching them they started to run away from the town
We told them Do not run away
Come back to your luxuries and your houses so that you can be questioned
They said Woe to us
We have been unjust
Such was what they continued to say until We mowed them down and made them completely extinct
We did not create the heavens and the earth just for fun
Had We wanted to play games We could have certainly done so with things at hand
We bring forward the Truth to crush and destroy falsehood it is doomed to be banished
Woe to you for your way of thinking about God
To Him belongs all those who are in the heavens and the earth
Those who are closer to Him are not too proud to worship Him nor do they get tired of worshipping
They glorify Him day and night without fail
Have they chosen deities from earth
Can such deities give life to anyone
Had there been other deities in the heavens and the earth besides God both the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed
God the Lord of the Throne is too Glorious to be as they think He is
He will not be questioned about anything He does but all people will be questioned about their deeds
Have they chosen other gods besides God Muhammad ask them Show the proof in support of such belief
This is the Quran which tells us about the beliefs of the people in my time and those who lived before me Most of them do not know
Moreover the truth is that they neglect the question of belief altogether
To all the Messengers that were sent before you We revealed that I am the only God to be worshipped
They said The Beneficent God has given birth to a son
He is too Exalted to give birth to a son
Those whom they think are God s sons are only His honorable servants
These servants do not speak before He speaks They simply act according to His orders
He knows all that is in front of them and all that is behind them
These servants of God will not intercede with Him for anyone without His permission and they tremble in awe before His greatness
The recompense of those of them who say that they are the Lord instead of God will be hell thus do We recompense the unjust ones
Have the unbelievers not ever considered that the heavens and the earth were one piece and that We tore them apart from one another
From water We have created all living things
Will they then have no faith
We placed firm mountains on earth lest it would shake them away We made wide roads for them so that they might have the right guidance
We made the sky above them as a wellguarded ceiling but they have neglected the evidence of Our existence therein
It is God who has created the night the day the Sun and Moon and has made them swim in a certain orbit
We made no mortal before you immortal
Will they become immortal after you die
Every soul has to experience the taste of death We test you with both hardships and blessings
In the end you will all return to Us
Muhammad whenever the unbelievers see you they think that you deserve nothing more than to be mocked They say Is it he Muhammad who speaks against your gods
But they themselves have no faith at all in the Beneficent God
The human being is created hasty Tell them Do not be hasty for God will soon show you the evidence of His existence
They say When shall the Day of Judgment come to pass if you are true in your claim
Would that the unbelievers knew that no one would protect their faces and backs against the fire nor they would be helped
The fire will suddenly strike and confound them
They will not be able to repel it nor will they be given any respite
They mocked the Messengers who were sent before you thus the torment which they had ridiculed encompassed them all
Ask them Who can protect them from the wrath of the Beneficent God during the night and day
Yet they are neglectful about their Lord
Can their gods protect them against Us
Their gods have no power even to help themselves nor are they safe from Our retribution
We have been providing these men and their fathers with the means of enjoyment for a long time
Have they not ever considered that We populated the earth and then caused many of the inhabitants to pass away
Can they have any success in their wickedness
Muhammad tell them I am warning you by revelation alone
The deaf do not hear any call when they are warned
If a blast of the torment of your Lord strikes them they will say Woe to us
We have been unjust people
We shall maintain proper justice on the Day of Judgment
No soul will be wronged the least
For a deed even as small as a mustard seed one will duly be recompensed
We are efficient in maintaining the account
To Moses and Aaron We granted the criteria of discerning right from wrong and We gave them the light and a reminder to the pious ones
who fear their unseen Lord and are anxious about the Day of Judgment
This Quran which We have revealed is a blessed reminder
Will you then deny it
To Abraham We gave the right guidance and We knew him very well
Abraham asked his father and his people What are these statues which you worship
They replied We found our fathers worshipping them
He said Both you and your fathers have certainly been in error
They exclaimed Have you brought the Truth or are you joking
He said Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
It was He who created them and I testify to this fact
Abraham said to himself By God I will devise a plan against their idols when they are away
He broke all the idols into pieces except the biggest among them so that perhaps people would refer to it
When the people came to the temple and saw the broken idols they asked each other Who has done this to our gods He certainly is an unjust person
Some of them said We heard a youth called Abraham speaking against the idols
Their chiefs said Bring him before the eyes of the people and let them testify that he has spoken against the idols
They asked Abraham did you do this to our idols
He replied I think the biggest among them has broken the smaller ones
Ask them if they are able to speak
Thereupon they realized their own foolishness and said We ourselves are wrongdoers
With their heads cast down they said Abraham you know that idols do not speak How then can you ask such a question
He said Do you instead of God worship things that can neither harm nor benefit you
Woe to you for what you worship instead of God
Have you no understanding
They said Burn him to ashes if you want to help your gods
We said to the fire Be cool and peaceful with Abraham
They had devised an evil plan against Abraham but We turned it into failure
We took Abraham and Lot safely to the land in which We had sent blessings to the worlds
We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people
We appointed them as leaders to guide the people through Our command and sent them revelation to strive for good deeds worship their Lord and pay religious tax
Both of them were Our worshipping servants
To Lot We gave knowledge and wisdom and saved him from the people of the town who were committing indecent acts
They were certainly a bad and sinful people
We encompassed him in Our mercy he was a righteous man
We answered the prayer of Noah who had prayed to Us before and saved him and his followers from the great disaster
We helped him against the people who said Our revelations were mere lies
They were a bad people and We drowned them all
David and Solomon were trying to settle the case of the people s sheep that grazed in a cornfield at night We witnessed their decree in that matter
We made Solomon understand the law about the case and gave both David and Solomon knowledge and wisdom
We made the mountains and birds glorify the Lord along with David
We had also done to him such favors before
We taught him the art of making coats of mail so that you could protect yourselves during a war
Will you then give thanks
We made subservient to Solomon the swift wind that blew on his command to the land in which We had sent blessings
We have the knowledge of all things
We subdued the devils who would dive into the sea for him and perform other tasks for Solomon We kept them in his service
When Job prayed Lord I have been afflicted with hardships
Have mercy on me You are the Most Merciful of those who have mercy
We answered his prayer relieved him from his hardships brought his family back to him and gave him twice as much property as that which was destroyed It was a mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers
Ismael Idris and Dhul Kifl all were people of great patience
We encompassed them in Our mercy they were righteous people
Dhun Nun went away in anger and thought that We would never have power over him but in darkness he cried Lord You are the Only God whom I glorify I have certainly done wrong to myself so forgive me
We answered his prayer and saved him from his grief
Thus We save the faithful ones
Zachariah prayed Lord do not leave me alone without offspring although you are the best heir
We answered his prayer and granted him his son John by making his wife fruitful
They were people who would compete with each other in good deeds and pray to Us with love and reverence
With Us they were all humble people
Into the woman who maintained her chastity We breathed Our Spirit and made her and her son a miracle for all people
People you are one nation and I am your Lord
Worship Me
People have divided themselves into many sects but all will return to Us
The reward of the righteously striving believers will not be neglected
We are keeping the record of their good deeds
The people whom We destroyed can never return to this world
until Gog and Magog are let loose to rush down from the hills
The Day of Judgment will then draw near and the unbelievers will stare amazedly and cry Woe to us
We had neglected this day
We have done wrong
They will be told You and what you had worshipped instead of God will be the fuel of hell
Had the idols been true lords they would not have gone to hell
All of you will live therein forever
They will groan in pain therein but no one will listen to them
But those to whom We have already promised blessings will be far away from hell
They will not even hear the slightest sound from it while enjoying the best that they can wish for in their everlasting life
They will not be affected by the great terror The angels will come to them with this glad news This is your day which was promised to you
This will happen on the day when We roll up the heavens as if it were a written scroll and bring it back into existence just as though We had created it for the first time This is what We have promised and We have always been true to Our promise
We have written in the psalms which We had revealed after the Torah that the earth will be given to Our righteous servants as their inheritance
This is a lesson for those who worship God
Muhammad We have sent you for no other reason but to be a mercy for mankind
Say It is revealed to me that there is only one Lord
Will you then submit yourselves to His will
If they turn away tell them I have warned every one of you equally
I do not know when the torment which you have to suffer will take place
God knows well all that is spoken aloud and all that you hide
I do not know why God has commanded me to warn you of the torment Perhaps it is a trial for you and a respite for an appointed time
He also said Lord judge us with Truth
Our Lord is the Beneficent One whose help I ask against the blasphemies you say about Him
People have fear of your Lord the quake of the physical realm at the Hour of Doom will be terribly violent
When that hour comes every breastfeeding mother will drop her baby out of fear and every pregnant female will cast off her burden
You will see the people behaving as though they were drunk while in fact they are not drunk
They only will look such because of the severity of God s torment
Some people argue about God without knowledge and follow every rebellious devil
It has been decided that satan will mislead and submit anyone who establishes friendship with him to the torment of the burning fire
People if you have doubts about the Resurrection you must know that We created you from clay that was turned into a living germ
This was developed into a clot of blood which was made into a well formed and partly shapeless lump of flesh This is how We show you that resurrection is not more difficult for Us than your creation
We cause whatever We want to stay in the womb for an appointed time We then take you out of the womb as a baby so that you may grow up and receive strength
Some of you may then die and others may grow to a very old age and lose your memory
You may see the earth as a barren land but when we send rain it starts to stir and swell and produce various pairs of attractive herbs
This is because God is the Supreme Truth who gives life to the dead and who has power over all things
There is no doubt about the coming of the Hour of Doom and that God will raise every one from their graves
Some people argue about God without knowledge guidance and an enlightening Book
They turn away from the Truth to lead people away from the path of God
Their share in this world will be disgrace and on the Day of Judgment a burning torment
They will be told This is the result of what your hands have wrought God is certainly not unjust to His servants
Some people worship God to achieve worldly gains
They are confident when they are prosperous but when they face hardships they turn away from worship
They are lost in this life and will be lost in the life to come
Such loss is indeed destructive
They worship things instead of God which can neither harm them nor benefit them
This is indeed to stray far away from the right path
Their worship of such things in which there is no hope for any benefit can only harm them
How terrible is such a guardian and companion
God will admit the righteously striving believers to the gardens wherein streams flow
God has all the power to do whatever He wants
Those who thought that God would never grant victory to Muhammad in this world nor in the life hereafter and now that he is victorious should hang themselves by the necks from the ceiling then cut the rope and see if this can do away with what has enraged them
We have revealed the Quran which contains authoritative verses
God guides only those whom He wants
On the Day of Judgment God will make truth and falsehood clearly distinct from each other to the believers the Jews the Sabeans the Christian the Zoroastrians and the Pagans on the Day of Judgment
God is a Witness to all things
Have you not considered that those in the heavens and the earth the Sun the Moon the Stars the mountains the trees the animals and many people all bow down to God
But many people deserve His torment
No one can give honor to whomever God has insulted
God has all the power to do what He wants
Those who prostrate themselves before God and those who do not are two groups who dispute with each other about their Lord
For the unbelievers the garment of fire has already been prepared Boiling water will be poured upon their heads
It will melt their skins and all that is in their bellies
They will be subdued by iron rods
Whenever in anguish they will try to come out of hell they will be returned therein to suffer the burning torment
God will admit the righteously striving believers to the gardens wherein streams flow
There they will be decked with gold bracelets pearls and garments of silk
for they were guided to speak the noblest words and follow the praiseworthy path
A painful torment awaits the pagans who create obstacles in the way that leads to God and the Sacred Mosque which We have made for those who dwell nearby and foreigners alike and those who commit evil and injustice therein
When We prepared for Abraham the place to build the Sacred House We told him not to consider anything equal to Me and to keep the House clean for those walking around it those standing bowing down and prostrating in prayer
We commanded Abraham Call people for hajj an act of worship accomplished by visiting the sacred sites in Mecca They will come on foot and on lean camels from all the distant quarters
to see their benefits commemorate the name of God during the appointed days and offer the sacrifice of the cattle that God has given them They themselves should consume part of the sacrificial flesh and give the rest to the destitute and needy people
Let the pilgrims then neatly dress themselves fulfil their vows and walk seven times around the Kabah
Such are the regulations of hajj
To respect the prohibitions of God is a virtuous deed in the sight of one s Lord
Consuming the flesh of certain animals is made lawful for you
Stay away from wickedness idols and false words
As the upright servants of God do not consider anything equal to God
To consider things equal to God is like one falling from the sky who is snatched away by the birds or carried away by a strong wind to a far distant place
To respect the symbols of God is the sign of a pious heart
There are benefits for you in the sacrificial offerings of God until the appointed time when you slaughter them as your offering near the Ancient House
To every nation We have given certain sacrificial rituals Let them consecrate their sacrificial animals with His Name
Your God is One God and you must submit yourselves to His will
Muhammad give the glad news of God s mercy to the devoted servants of God
Those whose hearts are filled with awe on hearing about God who exercise patience in hardships who are steadfast in prayer and who spend their property for the cause of God
For you We have made the sacrificial camel one of the reminders of God
It also has other benefits for you
Consecrate it with the Name of God when it is steadily standing
When it is slaughtered consume its flesh and give part of it to the needy who do and those do not ask for help from others
Thus We have made the camel subservient to you so that perhaps you may give thanks
It is not the flesh and blood of your sacrifice that pleases God
What pleases God is your piety
God has made subservient to you the sacrificial animals so that perhaps you will glorify Him He is guiding you
Muhammad give the glad news of God s mercy to the righteous people
God defends the believers but He does not love any of the treacherous ungrateful ones
Permission to take up arms is hereby granted to those who are attacked they have suffered injustice
God has all the power to give victory
to those who were unjustly expelled from their homes only because they said God is our Lord
Had it not been for God s repelling some people through the might of the others the monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which God is very often worshipped would have been utterly destroyed
God shall certainly help those who help Him
He is Allpowerful and Majestic
He will certainly help those who if given power in the land will worship God through prayer pay the religious tax enjoin others do good and prevent them from committing evil
The consequence of all things is in the hands of God
If they have called you Muhammad a liar remember that the people of Noah Ad Thamud
and the people of Abraham Lot
Midian and Moses had also called their Prophets liars
I gave respite to the unbelievers then sized them with torment
How terrible was that torment
How many were the unjust dwellers of the towns that We destroyed From their trellises to their lofty mansions all were toppled and their wells were abandoned
Have they not travelled sufficiently in the land to have understanding hearts and listening ears
It is their hearts which are blind not their ears
They want you to bring upon them their punishment without delay
God never disregards His promise
One day for God is equal to a thousand years for you
To how many unjust towns have We given respite and then sized with torment
To Me do all things return
Muhammad tell them People I am giving you a clear warning
The righteously striving believers will receive forgiveness and honorable sustenance
Those who try to challenge Our miracles will be the dwellers of hell
Satan would try to tamper with the desires of every Prophet or Messenger whom We sent
Then God would remove Satan s temptations and strengthen His revelations
God is Allknowing and Allwise
He would make Satan s temptations a trial for those whose hearts are hard and sick
The wrongdoers are far away from the Lord
so that those who have received knowledge would know and believe that whatever happens with the Prophets and Messengers is the Truth from their Lord and will believe it
This will cause their hearts to become filled with awe
God guides the believers to the right path
The unbelievers will continue to doubt the Quran until the Hour of Doom suddenly sizes them or the torment of the last day strikes them
On that day it is God who will be the Absolute King and Judge of mankind
The righteously striving believers will go to Paradise
and the unbelievers who called Our revelations lies will suffer humiliating torment
Those who abandoned their homes for the cause of God and who then died or were murdered will receive honorable sustenance from God He is the Most Generous and Munificent
God will certainly admit them to a pleasant dwelling
God is Allknowing and Forbearing
One who is wronged and who retaliates by that which is equal to his suffering God will certainly help him He is Allpardoning and Allforgiving
God causes the night to enter the day and the day to enter the night He is Allhearing and Allaware
God is the Supreme Truth and whatever they worship instead of Him is falsehood God is most Exalted and most Great
Have you not seen that God has sent water from the sky and has made the earth green all over
He is Kind and Allaware
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Have you not seen that God through His command has made all that is in the earth and the ships that sail on the sea subservient to you He prevents the sky from falling on the earth unless He decides otherwise
God is Compassionate and Merciful to mankind
It is He who has given you life He will make you die and will make you live again Surely the human being is ungrateful
We enjoined every nation with certain worship acts which they perform
The unbelievers must not dispute with you about the manner of your worship
Invite them to follow the right path of the Lord
If they still dispute with you about your worship tell them God knows best what you do
He will issue His decree about your differences on the Day of Judgment
Do you not know that God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
His decree is already recorded in the Book and issuing such a Judgment is not difficult for Him at all
They worship things instead of God that have received no authority from the heavens nor have they any knowledge of such authority
The unjust people will have no one to help them
When Our authoritative revelations are recited to the unbelievers you can clearly read the dislike on their faces
They almost attack those who read Our revelations to them
Say to them Should I tell you about what is the worst thing for you than these revelations
It is the fire which God has prepared for the unbelievers
What a terrible destination
People listen to this parable Those whom you worship instead of God do not have the power to create even a fly even though all of them would come together for the task
If the fly was to snatch something from them they would not be able to rescue it from the fly
How feeble are such worshippers and that which they worship
They have not revered God properly
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
God chooses Messengers from both angels and human beings
God is Allhearing and Allaware
God knows all that they have and all that is behind them and to Him do all things return
Believers worship your Lord bow down and prostrate yourselves before Him and do virtuous deeds so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
Strive steadfastly for the Cause of God
He has chosen you but has not imposed on you hardship in your religion the noble religion of your father Abraham
God named you Muslims before and in this Book so that the Messenger will witness your actions and will be the witness over mankind
Be steadfast in your prayer pay the religious tax and seek protection from God He is your Guardian a gracious Guardian and Helper
Triumphant indeed are the believers
who are submissive to God in their prayers
who avoid impious talks
pay their religious tax
and restrain their carnal desires
except with their spouses and slavegirls
The practice of carnal relations is lawful with them
Those who desire to go beyond such limits they commit transgression
those who are true to their trust
to their promise
and who are steadfast in their prayer
These are the heirs of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We have created the human being from an extract of clay
which was then turned into a living germ and placed in safe depository
The living germ then was turned into a shapeless lump of flesh from which bones were formed The bones then were covered with flesh
At this stage We caused it to become another creature All blessings belong to God the best Creator
Thereafter you will certainly die
and you will be brought back to life again on the Day of Resurrection
We have created seven heavens above you and have never been neglectful to Our Creation
We have sent a measure of water from the sky to stay on earth and We have the power to take it away
We have established for you gardens of palm trees and vineyards with this water with many fruits for you to consume
We have also created for you the tree that grows on Mount Sinai which produces oil and relish for those who use it
There is a lesson for you concerning cattle
We provide you with drink from their bellies and many other benefits
You can consume them as meat
You are carried by the animals on land and by the ships in the sea
We sent Noah to his people who said My people worship God for He is your only Lord Will you then not have fear of Him
The chiefs of the unbelievers said to the others He is a mere mortal like you
He wants only to be superior to you
Had God wanted He would have sent the angels instead of him
We have never heard from our fathers anything like what he says
He is only an insane person
Wait for some time
Perhaps he will come to his senses
Noah prayed Lord help me they have called me a liar
We inspired him saying Build the Ark before Our eyes and by the instruction of Our revelation
When our decree comes to pass and water comes forth from the Oven embark in the Ark with a pair of every kind of animals and your family except those already doomed to perish
Do not plead with Me for the unjust they will be drowned
When all of you settle in the Ark say Only God Who has saved us from the unjust people deserves all praise
Say Lord grant us a blessed landing from the Ark You are the One who provides the safest landing
In this story there is enough evidence of the Truth thus do We try mankind
We brought another generation into existence after the people of Noah
We sent to them a Messenger from among their own people who told them Worship God He is your only Lord
Will you then not have fear of Him
A group of his people who disbelieved him and had called the Day of Judgment a lie and whom We had made prosperous in this life said He is a mere mortal like you
He eats and drinks as you do
If you follow a mortal like yourselves you will certainly be lost
Does he promise you that after you die and become dust and bones you will be brought back to life again
Such a promise will never come true
This is our only life
We live and will die but we will never be brought back to life again
He is only a man who invents lies against God so have no faith in him
The Messenger prayed Lord help me they have called me a liar
God replied After a very short time they will certainly regret for their deeds
A blast struck them for a just cause and We made them look like withered leaves
God keeps the unjust people away from His mercy
After them We brought another generation into existence
Every nation has an appointed life span
We sent Our messengers one after the other but whenever a Messenger would come to a nation its people would call him a liar and We would destroy one nation after the other thus only their stories were left behind them
God keeps the unbelievers far away from His Mercy
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our miracles and clear authority
to the Pharaoh and his nobles
But they behaved proudly and thought themselves superior people
They said Should we believe in two mere mortals who are like ourselves and whose people are our slaves
They called them liars and consequently were destroyed
We gave the Book to Moses so that perhaps they may have guidance
We made the son of Mary and his mother a miracle and settled them on a high land quite secure and watered by a spring
I told them Messengers eat from the pure things and act righteously I know all that you do
Your religion is one and I am your Lord
Have fear of Me
The people divided themselves into many sects each with their own book and each happy with whatever they had
Muhammad leave them alone in their dark ignorance for an appointed time
Do they think that We are helping them by giving them children and property
We provide them with the means of competing with each other in virtuous deeds but they do not realize this
Only those who are out of fear of Him humble before their Lord
who believe in the revelations of their Lord
who consider nothing equal to their Lord
who spend their property for the cause of God and whose hearts are afraid of their return
to God these are the ones who really compete with each other in virtuous deeds and are the foremost ones in the task
We do not impose on any soul what is beyond its capacity We have the Book which speaks the truth and no injustice will be done to it
In fact the hearts of the unbelievers are in the dark because of their ignorance of real virtue they act against it
But when We will strike with torment those unbelievers who are rich they will start to cry for help
We shall tell them Do not cry for help on this day you will receive none from Us
Our revelations had certainly been recited to you but you turned your backs to them
and arrogantly mocked and reviled them
Was it that you did not give any thought to it the Quran Was it different from what was revealed to your fathers
Or did you not recognize your Messenger and thus denied him Muhammad
or you said that he is possessed by satan
In fact he has brought you the truth but most of you dislike it
Had the truth followed their desires the heavens and the earth and all that is in them would have been destroyed
We sent them the Quran but they ignored it
Do they disbelieve because you asked them for payment
The reward that you will receive from your Lord is the best
He is the best Provider
Muhammad you certainly have called them to the right path
but those who disbelieve the life hereafter deviate from the right path
Even if We were to grant them mercy and rescue them from hardship they would still blindly persist in their rebellion
We struck them with torment but they did not submit themselves to their Lord nor did they make themselves humble
until We opened the gate of greater torment death and they suddenly found themselves in despair
It is God who has created ears eyes and hearts for you
Little are the thanks that you give
It is God who has settled you on the earth and before Him you will all be assembled
It is He who gives life and causes death and it is He who alternates night and day
Will you not then understand
They say exactly the same thing as the people who lived before
They say When we die and become dust and bones shall we then be raised up again
Our fathers and we have been given such promises before
These are no more than ancient legends
Muhammad say to them Tell me if you know to whom does the earth and its contents belong
They will quickly reply It belongs to God
Say Will you not then take heed
Ask them Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Great Throne
They will quickly say It is God
Say Will you not then have fear of Him
Ask them If you have any knowledge in whose hands is the ownership of all things Who is the one who gives protection and yet He Himself is never protected
They will reply spontaneously It is God
Ask them Why has falsehood bewitched you
We have sent them the truth and they certainly are liars
God has never given birth to a son and there is no other god besides Him
If there were each god would have taken away his creatures and claimed superiority over the others
God is too exalted to be as they believe Him to be
He has the knowledge of all seen and unseen things
He is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Say Lord if you will afflict them with punishment
exclude me from the unjust people
We have the Power to strike them with torment before your very eyes
Respond to the injustice done to you with the better deed
We know best what they attribute to God
Say Lord I seek your protection against the strong temptations of the devils
I seek your protection should they approach me
When death approaches one of the unbelievers he says Lord send me back again
so that perhaps I shall act righteously for the rest of my life
Although he will say so but his wish will never come true
After death they will be behind a barrier until the day of their resurrection
There will be no kindred relations nor any opportunity to ask about others or seek their assistance after the trumpet has sounded
If the side of ones good deeds weighs heavier on a scale he will have everlasting happiness
but if it weighs less one will be lost forever in hell
The fire will scorch their faces and they will be groaning therein in pain
They will be told Were Our revelations not recited to you and did you not call them lies
They will reply Lord our hardheartedness overcame us and we went astray
Lord take us out of this and if we sin again we shall certainly be unjust
He will say Be quiet and say nothing
There was a group of my servants among you who always prayed Lord forgive us and grant us mercy You are the best of those who show mercy
You mocked and laughed at them until you forgot all about Me
On this day I have given them their reward for their exercising patience and it is they who have triumphed
God will ask them How many years did you live in your graves
They will reply We remained for about a day or part of it but ask those who have kept count
God will say You have indeed remained there for a short time
Would that you knew it during your life time
Did you think that We had created you for a playful purpose and that you were not to return to Us
God is the most exalted King and the Supreme Truth
He is the only God and the Lord of the Gracious Throne
One who worships things besides God has no proof of the authority of such things God is certainly keeping the record of his deeds
The unbelievers will not have everlasting happiness
Muhammad say Lord forgive me and grant me mercy You are the best of the Merciful Ones
This is a chapter which We have revealed to you and made obligatory for you to follow its guidance
We have revealed clear verses in it so that perhaps you may take heed
Flog the fornicatress and the fornicator with a hundred lashes each
Let there be no reluctance in enforcing the laws of God if you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment
Let it take place in the presence of a group of believers
No one should marry a fornicator except a fornicatress or a pagan woman
No one should marry a fornicatress except a fornicator or a pagan man
Such marriage is unlawful to the believers
Those who accuse married women of committing adultery but are not able to prove their accusation by producing four witness must be flogged eighty lashes
Never accept their testimony thereafter because they are sinful
except that of those who afterwards repent and reform themselves God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who accuse their spouses of committing adultery but have no witness except themselves should testify four times saying God is my witness that I am telling the truth
They should say on the fifth time Let God s curse be upon me if I am a liar
The spouse will be acquitted of the punishment if she challenges his testimony by saying four times God is my witness that he is a liar
On the fifth time she should say Let the curse of God be upon me if what he says is true
Had it not been for God s favors and mercy upon you your life would have been in chaos
God accepts repentance and He is Allwise
Those of you who have brought forward a false report against Aisha do not think that it will harm you
Rather it will be a benefit to you
Each one of you will face the result of his sin
The one among the group who was the chief instigator will face a great torment
Would that on your hearing this report the believing men and woman among you had a favorable attitude towards it and had said This report is clearly false
Would that they had brought four witness to testify to their report
Since they brought none they are liars before God
Were it not for the favors and mercy of God upon you in this world and in the life to come a great torment would strike you for your involvement in this false report
Your tongues moved and your mouths spoke of something of which you had no knowledge
You thought it to be a trivial matter while in the eyes of God it is blasphemy
Would that on hearing this report you had said We have nothing to say about it
God forbid
It is a serious accusation
God advises you never to do such things again if you have any faith
God explains to you His revelations
He is Allknowing and Allwise
Those who like to publicize indecency among the believers will face painful torment in this world and in the life to come
God knows what you do not know
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God upon you you would have faced painful punishment in this world and the life to come
God is Compassionate and Merciful
Believers do not follow the footsteps of satan whoever does so will be made by satan to commit indecency and sin
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God none of you would ever have been purified
God purifies whomever He wants
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
The welltodo and the rich among you should not fail to give to relatives the destitute and Emigrants for the cause of God
Be considerate and forgiving
Do you not want God to forgive you
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who slander the unaware but chaste and believing women of committing unlawful carnal relations are condemned in this life and in the life hereafter
They will suffer a great punishment
on the day when their tongues hands and feet will testify to what they had done
On that day God will give them due recompense and they will know that God is the Supreme Judge
Indecent woman are for indecent men and indecent men are for indecent woman
Decent women are for decent men and decent men are for decent women
The decent people are innocent of what people allege
They will receive mercy and honorable sustenance
Believers do not enter other s houses until you have asked permission and have greeted the people therein
This is best for you so that perhaps you may remember God s guidance
If you do not find anyone therein do not enter until you are given permission
If you are told to go away do so this is more decent of you
God knows all that you do
There is no harm for you to enter uninhabited houses where you have some goods
God knows whatever you reveal or hide
Muhammad tell the believing men to cast down their eyes and guard their carnal desires this will make them more pure
God is certainly aware of what they do
Tell the believing woman to cast down their eyes guard their chastity and not to show off their beauty except what is permitted by the law Let them cover their breasts with their veils
They must not show off their beauty to anyone other than their husbands father fatherinlaws sons stepsons brothers sons of brothers and sisters women of their kind their slaves immature male servants or immature boys They must not stamp their feet to show off their hidden ornaments
All of you believers turn to God in repentance so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
Marry the single people among you and the righteous slaves and slavegirls
If you are poor God will make you rich through His favor He is Bountiful and Allknowing
Let those who cannot find someone to marry maintain chastity until God makes them rich through His favors
Let the slaves who want to buy their freedom have an agreement with you in writing if you find them to be virtuous
Give them money out of God s property which He has given to you
Do not force your girls into prostitution to make money if they want to be chaste
If they have been compelled to do so God will be Allmerciful and Allforgiving to them
We have revealed to you illustrious revelations stories of the past generations and good advice for the pious people
God is the light of the heavens and the earth
A metaphor for His light is a niche in which there is a lamp placed in a glass
The glass is like a shining star which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither eastern nor western
Its oil almost lights up even though it has not been touched by the fire
It is light upon light
God guides to His light whomever He wants
God uses various metaphors
He has the knowledge of all things
This niche is in the houses that God has declared to be highly respected and His Name be mentioned therein in glory in the morning and evening
by people who can neither be diverted by merchandise nor bargaining from worshipping God saying their prayers and paying religious tax
They do these things for they are afraid of the day when all hearts and eyes will undergo terrible unrest and crisis
They worship Him so that God will reward their best deeds and give them more through His favors God gives sustenance to whomever He wants without account
The deeds of the unbelievers are like a mirage which a thirsty man thinks is water until he goes near and finds nothing
Instead he finds God who gives him his due recompense
God s reckoning is swift
Or it the deeds of the unbelievers are like the darkness of a deep stormy sea with layers of giant waves covered by dark clouds
It is darkness upon darkness whereby even if one stretches out his hands he can not see them
One can have no light unless God gives him light
Have you not considered that all that is between the heavens and the earth glorifies God and that the birds spread their wings in the air to glorify God
He knows everyone s prayers and praising God has absolute knowledge of what they do
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to Him do all things return
Do you not see that God moves the clouds gently brings them together piles them up and then you can see the rain coming from them
He sends down hailstones from the mountains in the sky With them He strikes or protects from them whomever He wants
The lightening can almost take away the sight
God alternates the night and the day
In this there is a lesson for the people of understanding
God has created every living being from water Some of them creep on their bellies some walk on two feet and some of them walk on four legs
God creates whatever He wants
He has power over all things
We have revealed illustrious revelations
God guides to the right path whomever He wants
They say We have believed in God and the Messenger and we have obeyed them
Then a group of them turn away from their belief They are not believers
When they are called to God and His Messenger so that they will judge among them suddenly some of them turn away
If right was on their side they would come quickly
Are their hearts sick
Do they have doubts or are they afraid that God and His Messenger may do injustice to them
In fact they themselves are unjust
When the believers are called to God and His Messenger to be judged their only words are We have listened and obeyed
They will have everlasting happiness
Those who obey God and His Messenger who are humble before Him and who have fear of Him will certainly be successful
They strongly swear by God that they would march to fight for the cause of God if you were to order them to
Tell them You do not need to swear fighting for the cause of God is a virtuous deed and God is Well Aware of what you do
Say to them Obey God and His Messenger
If you turn away the Messenger and the people will each be responsible for their own obligations
If you follow the Messenger you will have the right guidance
The responsibility of the Messenger is only to preach
God has promised the righteously striving believers to appoint them as His deputies on earth as He had appointed those who lived before He will make the religion that He has chosen for them to stand supreme
He will replace their fear with peace and security so that they will worship God alone and consider no one equal to Him Whoever becomes an unbeliever after this will be a sinful person
Be steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax and obey the Messenger so that perhaps you will receive mercy
The unbelievers should not think that they can defeat God on earth
Their dwelling will be hell the most terrible abode
Believers your slaves and the immature people must ask your permission three times a day before entering your house before the morning prayer at noon time and after the late evening prayer these are most private times
After your permission has been granted there is no harm if they come into your presence from time to time
This is how God explains His revelations to you
God is Allknowing and Allwise
When your children become mature they must ask your permission before entering your house as the rest of the mature people do
Thus does God explain to you His revelations
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Elderly women who have no hope of getting married are allowed not to wear the kind of clothing that young woman must wear as long as they do not show off their beauty
It is better for them if they maintain chastity
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
It is no sin for the blind the lame the sick ones and yourselves to eat at your own homes or the homes of your father mothers brothers sisters your paternal and maternal uncles aunts or at the homes of your friend and the homes with which you are entrusted
It makes no difference whether you eat all together or one person at a time
When you enter a house say the blessed greeting which God has instructed you to say Thus does God explain to you His revelations so that perhaps you will understand
The true believers are those who have faith in God and His Messenger and when they are dealing with the Messenger in important matters they do not leave without his permission
Muhammad those who ask your permission believe in God and His Messenger
When they ask your leave to attend to their affairs you may give permission to anyone of them you choose and ask forgiveness for them from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not address the Messenger as you would call each other God knows those who secretly walk away from you and hide themselves Those who oppose the Messengers should beware lest some trouble or a painful torment should befall them
The heavens and the earth certainly belong to God
He surely knows all about you in this life
On the day when you return to Him He will tell you all about whatever you have done
God has the knowledge of all things
Blessed is He who has revealed the criteria for discerning truth from falsehood to His servant so that He could warn mankind
To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He has not begotten any sons nor does He have any partner in His kingdom
He has created all things with precisely accurate planning
Yet they have chosen for themselves other deities besides Him who do not create anything but rather are themselves created who have no power over their own benefits or trouble and who have no control over life death and resurrection
The unbelievers say This Quran is no more than a slanderous statement which he Muhammad with the help of some other people has falsely invented Certainly this statement is unjust and sinful
They have also said It the Quran is only ancient legends which were written down while they were dictated to him in the mornings and the evenings
Muhammad tell them The One who knows all the secrets of the heavens and the earth has revealed it He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
They say Why does this Messenger eat food and walk in the streets
Why has not an angel been sent to him so that they could preach the message together
Why has a treasure not been laid out for him or a garden from which he could eat been given to him
The unjust ones say You are merely following a bewitched person
Look at their various views about you
They have gone astray and are not able to find the right path
Blessed is He who could give you palaces and gardens wherein streams would flow far better than what they want you to have
They deny the Hour of Doom so We have prepared for them a burning fire
Even if they were to see this fire from a distant place they would only listen to its raging and roaring
When they are thrown bound into a narrow place therein then only will they wish for their death
They will be told Do not pray to die only once but pray to die many times
Muhammad ask them Is what you want better or the eternal garden promised to the pious ones as their reward and dwelling
Therein they will eternally have whatever they want
This is a binding promise from your Lord
On the day when the unbelievers and whatever they had been worshipping besides God will be resurrected He will ask the idols Did you mislead My servants or did they themselves go astray from the right path
They will reply Lord You alone deserve all glory
We were not supposed to choose any guardian other than you
Since you have been benevolent to these people and their fathers they forgot Your guidance and thus became subject to perdition
God will say to the idolaters Your idols have rejected your faith
You cannot avoid their rejection nor can you find any help
Anyone of you who commits injustice will be made to suffer a great torment
All the Messengerss whom We sent before certainly ate food and walked through the streets
We have made some of you people a trial for the others
Would you then exercise patience
Your Lord is Allaware
Those who have no desire to meet Us have said Would that the angels had been sent to us or that we could see our Lord
They are really filled with pride and have committed the greatest and worst kind of rebellion and hostility
On the day when the criminals see the angels there will certainly be no rejoicing for them
Rather they will plead to the angels Please keep away from us do not drive us into hell
We shall call their deeds into Our presence and scatter them into the air as dust turn them devoid of all virtue
The dwellers of Paradise on that day will have the best residence and resting place
On that day the sky will be crystal blue clear of clouds The angels will descend in groups
and the Absolute kingdom will belong to the Beneficent God
It will be a hard day for the unbelievers It will be a day when the unjust will bite their fingers regretfully saying Would that we had followed the path of the Messengers
Woe to us
Would that we had not been friends with so and so
He led me away from the true guidance after it had come to us
Satan is a traitor to people
The Messengers will say Lord my people had abandoned this Quran
Thus from the sinful people We made enemies for every Prophet
Your Lord is a Sufficient Guide and Helper
The unbelievers have said Why was the whole Quran not revealed to him at once
We have revealed it to you in gradual steps to strengthen your hearts and give you explanations
We will support you with the Truth and the best interpretation whenever the infidels argue against you
Those who will be driven headlong into hell will have a terrible dwelling they have certainly gone astray
We gave the Book to Moses and made his brother Aaron his Minister
We told them Both of you go to the people who have rejected Our revelations
We completely destroyed these unbelievers
We drowned the people of Noah because of their rejection of the Messengers and made them evidence of the Truth for mankind
We have prepared a painful torment for the unjust ones
To each of the tribes of Ad Thamud the settlers around the well and many generations in between
We gave guidance and drove each to destruction
Our Messengers came into the town which was struck by a fatal rain
Did they unbelievers not see what had happened to this town
In fact they had no faith in the Resurrection
Muhammad when they see you they will only mock you and say Has God really sent him as a Messengers
Had we not been steadfast he would almost have led us astray from our gods
On facing torment they will soon know who had really gone astray
How can you be the guardian of those who have chosen their own desires as their Lord
Do you think that most of them listen and understand
They are like cattle or even more straying and confused
Have you not seen that your Lord increases the shadow
Had He wanted He would have made it stationary and has made the sun their guide
Then He reduces it in gradual steps
It is He who has made the night as a covering for you sleep as a rest for you and the day for you to rise again
It is He who sends the winds to you with the glad news of His mercy and who sends purifying rain from the sky
to revive the barren land and provide water for many creatures cattle and people
We send them rain from time to time so that they may take heed
Many people have responded but ungratefully
Had We wanted We could have sent a Prophet to every town
Do not yield to the unbelievers but launch a great campaign against them with the help of the Quran
It is He who has joined the two seas one palatable and sweet the other bitterly salty and has established a barrier between them as a partition
It is He who has created the human being from water to have relationships of both lineage and wedlock
Your Lord has all power
They worship besides God things that can neither benefit nor harm them
The unbelievers are defiant against their Lord
We have sent you for no other reason but to be a bearer of glad news and warning
Tell them I ask no recompense for my preaching to you except the fact that whoever wants should choose the way of God
Also trust in the Living One who never dies and glorify Him with His praise
He has sufficient knowledge of the sins of His servants
It is He who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and then He established His domination over the Throne
He is the Beneficent God Refer to Him as the final authority
When they are told to prostrate themselves before the Beneficent God they say Who is the Beneficent God
Why should we prostrate ourselves before the one whom you have commanded us to
This only increases their rebelliousness
Blessed is He who has established constellations in the sky and made therein a lamp and a shining moon
It is He who has made the night and the day one proceeding the other for whoever wants to take heed or give thanks
Among the servants of the Beneficent God are those who walk gently on the earth and when addressed by the ignorant ones their only response is Peace be with you
They are those who spend the night worshipping their Lord prostrating and standing
who pray Lord protect us from the torment of hell it is a great loss
It is a terrible abode and an evil station
who in their spending are neither extravagant nor stingy but maintain moderation
who do not worship idols besides God nor without a just cause murder a soul to whom God has granted amnesty who do not commit fornication for those who do so have committed a sin
and on the Day of Judgment their torment will be double They will suffer forever in disgrace
But only those who repent and believe and act righteously will have their sins replaced by virtue God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who repent and act righteously have truly returned to God
those who do not testify falsely and when they come across something impious pass it by nobly
who when reminded of the revelations of their Lord do not try to ignore them as though deaf and blind Rather they try to understand and think about them
They pray Lord let our spouses and children be the delight of our eyes and ourselves examples for the pious ones
They will all receive Paradise as their reward for their forbearance and patience where they will be greeted with Peace be with you
They will live therein forever the best abode and place of rest
Muhammad say to the disbeliever It does not matter to my Lord whether you worship Him or not
You have rejected His guidance and your punishment is inevitable
Sin Mim
These are the verses of the illustrious Book
You will perhaps kill yourself with anguish because they are not accepting the faith
Had We wanted We would have sent them a miracle from the sky to make their heads hang down in submission
Whenever a new message comes to them from the Beneficent God they turn away from it
They have called our revelation lies
They will soon learn the consequences of what they mocked
Have they not seen the earth in which We have made gracious plants grow
In this there is certainly evidence of the Truth
But most of them have no faith
Your Lord is the Majestic and the Allmerciful
When Your Lord told Moses to go to the unjust people of the Pharaoh
and ask them Why do you not fear God
He replied Lord I am afraid that they will call me a liar
I feel nervous and my tongue is not fluent so send Aaron with me
They have charged me with a crime for which I am afraid they will kill me
The Lord said Have no fear both of you go with Our miracles
We shall closely listen to you
They came to the Pharaoh and said We are the Messengerss of the Lord of the Universe
Send the Israelites with us
The Pharaoh said Did we not bring you up in our home as an infant and did you not live with us for many years
and you did the deed which you did
You are certainly ungrateful
Moses said I did do it and I made a mistake
Then I ran away from you in fear but my Lord granted me the law and has appointed me as a Messenger
And this is the favor with which you oblige me You have made the Israelites your slaves
The Pharaoh asked Who is the Lord of the Universe
Moses replied The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you want to be certain
The Pharaoh said to the people around him Did you hear that
Moses continued He is the Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
The Pharaoh said The Messengers who has been sent to you is certainly insane
Moses continued He is the Lord of the East and West and all that is between them if only you would think
Pharaoh said If you put forward any god other than me I will surely put you in prison
Moses asked What if I were to bring you clear proof of the existence of God
The Pharaoh replied Bring it if you are telling the truth
Moses threw his staff and suddenly it became a serpent
Then he uncovered his hand and it was sheer white to the onlookers
The Pharaoh said to the people around him He is certainly a skillful magician
He wants to expel you from your land through his magic
What is your opinion
They said Hold him and his brother off for a while
and summon every skillful magician from all the cities
So all the magicians gathered together
at the appointed time
and the people were asked Will you all be there so that we may follow the magicians if they become victorious
When the magicians came they asked the Pharaoh Will there be any reward for us if we win
He replied You will then be my closest associates
Moses asked the magicians Cast down what you want to
So they cast down their ropes and staffs saying By the honor of the Pharaoh we shall certainly become the winners
Then Moses cast down his staff and suddenly it swallowed up what they had falsely invented
The magicians fell down in adoration
saying We believe in the Lord of the Universe
and the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said You believed without my permission
He seems to be your chief who has taught you magic
But you will soon know the result of what you have done
I shall certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all together
They said It does not matter We shall be returning to our Lord
We hope that our Lord will forgive us for our sins we were not believers at first
We sent a revelation to Moses telling him to leave with our servants during the night they would be pursued by the Pharaoh
The Pharaoh sent word to all the cities saying
There is a small group of people
who have enraged us greatly
We are warning all of you about them
We deprived them the unbelievers of gardens springs
treasures and graceful dwellings
Thus we let the Israelites inherit them all
The people of the Pharaoh pursued them at sunrise
When the two groups came close to each other the companions of Moses said We will be caught
Moses said Certainly not
My Lord is with me and He will certainly guide me
We sent a revelation to Moses saying Strike the sea with your staff The sea was rent asunder and each side stood high up like a huge mountain
Then We brought the two parties closer
We saved Moses and all the people with him
and drowned the other party
In this there was certainly evidence of the Truth but most of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is certainly Majestic and Allmerciful
Tell them the story of Abraham
when he asked his father and others What do you worship
They replied We worship idols and shall continue to worship them
He asked them Can the idols hear you when you pray to them
or can they benefit or harm you
They said No but our fathers worshipped them
Abraham said Do you know that what you worship and what your grandfathers worshipped
are my enemies Not so the Lord of the Universe
He created me and He will guide me
It is He who gives me food and drink
and heals me when I am sick
He will cause me to die and will bring me back to life
It is He whom I expect to forgive my sins on the Day of Judgment
Lord grant me authority Join me to the righteous ones
Make my words come true in the future
Make me inherit the bountiful Paradise
Forgive my father
He has gone astray
Do not betray me
on the Day of Judgment when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit
except what is done in obedience to God with a submissive heart
On the Day of Judgment Paradise will be brought near
the pious and hell will be left open for the rebellious ones
who will be asked What did you worship
besides God
Will the idols help you
Can they help themselves
The idol worshippers the idols the rebellious ones
and the army of satan will all be thrown headlong into hell
Quarrelling therein with each other
they will say By God we were in clear error
when we considered you equal to the Lord of the Universe
Only the sinful ones made us go astray
We have no one to intercede for us before God
nor a loving friend
Would that we could have a chance to live again so that we might become believers
In this there is evidence of the truth but many of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is certainly Majestic and Allmerciful
The people of Noah rejected the Messengerss
span class col Their brother Noah asked them Why do you not fear God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I ask no payment from you for my preaching
The Lord of the Universe will give me my reward
Have fear of God and obey me
They said Should we believe in you when no one has followed you except the lowest ones
Noah said I have no knowledge of their deeds
If only you would realize their account is with my Lord
I do not drive away the believers
I am only a Prophet
They said Noah if you do not desist you will certainly be stoned to death
Then Noah said Lord my people have rejected me
Judge among us and save me and the believers with me
We saved him and those who were with him in a fully laden Ark
and drowned the others
In this there is evidence of the truth but most of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tribe of Ad rejected the Messengers
Their brother Hud asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask for any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you build useless monuments on every mountain
and raise strong mansions as if you were to live forever
When you attack you attack as tyrants do
Have fear of God and obey me
Have fear of the One who has bestowed upon you all that you know
He has given you cattle children
gardens and springs
I am afraid that you will suffer the torment of the Day of Judgment
They said Whether you preach to us or not
your preaching is nothing but ancient legends and we shall not face any torment
They rejected him and We destroyed them
In this there is evidence of the Truth yet most of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tribe of Thamud rejected the Messengers
Their brother Salih asked them Why do you not fear God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask for any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you think that you will remain here peacefully forever
amidst the gardens springs
farms and palmtrees in thick groves
carving comfortable houses out of the mountains
Have fear of God and obey me
Do not obey the orders of the transgressors
who spread evil in the land with no reform
They said You are only bewitched and insane
You are a mere mortal like us
Show us a miracle if you are telling the Truth
He said This is a shecamel
She will have her share of water as you have your share each on a certain day
Do not cause her to suffer lest you become subject to the torment of the great day of Judgment
They slew the shecamel but later became regretful
and torment struck them
In this there is evidence of the Truth yet many people do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The people of Lot rejected the Messengers
Their brother Lot asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you in the world want to have carnal relations with males
instead of your wives whom your Lord has created specially for you
You are a transgressing people
They said Lot if you do not give up preaching you will certainly be expelled from this town
He said I certainly hate what you practice
Lord save me and my family from their deeds
We saved him and all of his family
except an old woman who remained behind
We destroyed the others
by pouring upon them a terrible shower of rain
How evil was the rain for those who had been warned
In this there is an evidence of the Truth but many of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The dwellers of the forest also rejected the Messengers
Shu ayb asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Maintain just measure in your business and do not cause loss to others
Weigh your goods with proper balance
and do not defraud people in their property or spread evil in the land
Have fear of the One who has created you and the generations that lived before you
They said You are no more than a bewitched and insane man
and a mere mortal like us
We think you are a liar
Let a part of the sky fall on us if what you say is true
He said My Lord knows all that you do
They rejected him and then the torment of the gloomy day struck them
It was certainly a great torment
In this there is an evidence of the Truth but many of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
This Quran is certainly the revelation from the Lord of the Universe
It has been revealed through the trustworthy Spirit
to your heart so that you will warn the people of the dangers of disobeying God
It has been revealed in plain Arabic
Its news was also mentioned in the ancient Books
Is not the fact that the Israelite scholars already knew about the Quran through their Book sufficient evidence for the pagans of the truthfulness of the Quran
Had We revealed it to a nonArab
who would have read it to them they pagans would not have believed in it
Thus it passes through the hearts of the criminals
They will not believe in it until they suffer the painful torment
The torment will strike them suddenly without their knowledge
They will say Can we be granted any respite
Do they want to hasten Our torment
Do you not see that even if We give them respite for years
and then Our torment will strike them
none of their luxuries will be able to save them from the torment
We never destroyed any town without first sending to them warning and guidance
We have never been unjust to anyone
The satans have not revealed the Quran
they are not supposed to do so
Nor do have they the ability for such a task
The satans are barred from listening to anything from the heavens
Muhammad do not worship anything besides God lest you suffer the punishment
Warn your close relatives
and be kind to your believing followers
If they disobey you tell them I condemn your disobedient deeds
Have trust in the Majestic and Allmerciful God
who can see whether you stand up
or move during your prostration with the worshippers
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Should I tell you to whom the satans come
They come to every sinful liar
The satans try to listen to the heavens but many of them are liars
Only the erring people follow the poets
Have you not seen them wandering and bewildered in every valley
and preaching what they themselves never practice
The righteously striving believers among them who remember God very often and use their talent to seek help after they have been wronged are the exceptional The unjust will soon know how terrible their end will be
Ta Sin
These are the verses of the Quran and of the illustrious Book
They are glad news and guidance for the believers
who are steadfast in prayer who pay the religious tax and who have strong faith in the life hereafter
We have made the deeds of those who do not believe in the life to come attractive to them and they wander about blindly
They will suffer the worst kind of torment and will be lost in the life to come
Muhammad you have certainly received the Quran from the Allwise and Allknowing One
Moses said to his family I have seen some fire I shall bring you some news about it or some fire so that you can warmyourselves
When he approached the fire he was told Blessed is the one in the fire and those around it
All glory belongs to God the Lord of the Universe
Moses I am God the Majestic and Allwise
Throw down your staff
When Moses saw his staff on the ground moving like a living creature he stepped back and did not come forward again
The Lord said Moses do not be afraid
Messengers do not become afraid in My presence
Only the unjust become afraid in My presence
Even to these people who replace their bad deeds by good ones I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Put your hand into your pocket It will come out sheer white but unharmed
This is one of the nine miracles which shall be showing to the Pharaoh and his people they are truly wicked men
When Our miracles were visibly shown to them they said It is plain magic
They rejected the evidence because of their arrogance and injustice although their souls knew it to be true
Think how terrible the end of the sinful ones was
We gave knowledge to David and Soloman They said It is only God who deserves all praise
He has exalted us above many of His believing servants
Solomon became the heir to David He said People we have been taught the language of the birds and have been granted a share of everything
This indeed is a manifest favor from God
Soloman s army consisting of human beings jinn and birds were gathered together in his presence in ranks
When they arrived in the valley of the ants one ant said to the others Enter your dwellings lest you be carelessly crushed by Soloman and his army
Solomon smiled at the ant s remarks and said Lord inspire me to thank you for Your favors to me and my parents and to act righteously so as to please you
Admit me by your mercy into the company of Your righteous servants
Solomon inspected the birds and said How is it that I cannot see the hoopoe
Is he absent
I shall certainly punish him severely or slaughter him unless he has a good reason for his absence
Not long after the hoopoe came forward and said I have information which you do not have
I have come from the land of Sheba with a true report
I found a woman ruling the people there and she possessed something of almost everything and a great throne
I found her and her people prostrating before the sun instead of God
Satan has made their deeds attractive to them He has kept them away from the right path and they have no guidance
Satan has done this so that they will not worship God who brings forth whatever is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows whatever you conceal or reveal
God is the only Lord and master of the Great Throne
Solomon said We shall see whether you are truthful or a liar
Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then return and see what their reply will be
The Queen of Sheba said to her officials A gracious letter has been dropped before me
It reads From Soloman In the Name of God the Beneficent and the Merciful
Do not consider yourselves superior to me but come to me as Muslims in submission
She said My officials what are your views on this matter
I will not decide until I have your views
They replied We have great power and valor You are the commander so decide as you like
She said When Kings enter a town they destroy it and disrespect its honorable people
That is what they will do too
I will send a gift and we shall see what response the Messengers will bring
When her Messengers came to Soloman he said Have you brought me wealth
What God has given to me is far better than what He has given to you but you are happy with your gifts
Go back to your people and we shall soon come there with an army which they will not be able to face We shall drive them from their town humble and disgraced
Solomon asked his people Who among you can bring her throne before she the queen of Sheba comes to me submissively
A monstrous jinn said I can bring it before you even stand up
I am powerful and trustworthy
The one who had knowledge from the Book said I can bring it to you before you even blink your eye
When Solomon saw the throne placed before him he said This is a favor from my Lord by which He wants to test whether I am grateful or ungrateful
Whoever thanks God does so for his own good
Whoever is ungrateful to God should know that my Lord is SelfSufficient and Benevolent
Then he said Make a few changes to her throne and let us see whether she will recognize it or not
When she came she was asked Is your throne like this
She replied It seems that this is it
We had received the knowledge before this and were submissive to Solomon s power
Her idols prevented her from believing in God and she was an infidel
She was told to enter the palace
When she saw it she thought that it was a pool and raised her clothe up to her legs
Solomon said This is a palace constructed with glass
She said My Lord indeed I have wronged myself and I submit myself with Solomon to the will of God the Lord of the Universe
We sent to the tribe of Thamud their brother Salih so that they would worship God but they became two quarrelling groups
Salih said My people why do you commit sins so quickly before doing good
Would that you ask forgiveness from God so that perhaps He will have mercy upon you
They said We have an ill omen about you and your followers
Salih replied God has made your ill fortune await you
You are a people on trial
There were nine tribes in the city spreading evil without any reform in the land
They said Let us swear by God to do away with him and his family during the night then tell his guardian that we did not see how he and his family had been destroyed and we shall be telling the truth
They plotted and We planned without their knowledge Consider the result of their plot
We destroyed them and their people altogether
Those are their empty houses which We ruined because of their injustice
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of knowledge
We saved the faithful Godfearing believers
Lot asked his people Do you understandably commit indecency
Do you have carnal relations with men rather than women
You are ignorant people
His people had no answer but to say Expel Lot and his family from the town for they want to be pure
We saved Lot and his family except his wife who was destined to remain behind
We sent to them a terrible rainstorm
How horrible was the rain for the people who had already received warning
Muhammad say It is only God who deserves all praise
Peace be upon His chosen servants
Which is better God or the idols
Are the idols worthier or the One who has created the heavens and the earth who has sent water from the sky for you who has established delightful gardens and you could not even plant one tree
Is there any Lord besides God
In fact the unbelievers are the ones who deviate from the right path
Are the idols worthier or the One who has made the earth a resting place the rivers flow from its valleys the mountains as anchors and a barrier between the two seas
Is there any lord besides God
In fact most people do not know
Are the idols worthier or the One who answers the prayers of the distressed ones removes their hardship and makes you the successors in the land
Is there any lord besides God
In fact you take very little heed
Are the idols worthier or the One who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea and sends the winds bearing the glad news of His mercy
Is there any lord besides God
God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Are the idols worthier or the One who began the creation and who will turn it back who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth
Is there any lord besides God
Say Bring your proof if what you say is true
Muhammad say No one in the heavens or the earth knows the unseen except God and no one knows when they will be resurrected
Their knowledge of the next life is no more than doubts In fact they are blind about it
The unbelievers have said Shall we and our fathers be brought out of the graves after we become dust
It was promised to us and to our fathers before us
It is only ancient legends
Say Travel through the land and see how terrible was the end of the criminal ones
Muhammad do not be grieved about their disbelief nor distressed about their evil plans against you
They ask When the Day of Judgment will come if it is true at all
Say Perhaps some of the things which you wish to experience immediately are very close to you
Your Lord has many favors for mankind but most of them are ungrateful
Your Lord certainly knows whatever their hearts conceal or reveal
All the secrets in heavens and earth are recorded in the illustrious Book
This Quran tells the Israelites most of the matters about which they had disputes among themselves
It is a guide and mercy for the believers
Your Lord will judge among them according to His own decree
He is Majestic and AllKnowing
Trust in God for you follow the manifest truth
You cannot make the dead listen and the deaf are unable to hear calls Thus they turn back on their heels
You cannot guide the straying blind ones
You can only make hear those who believe in Our revelations submissively
When the word about them comes true We shall make a creature appear to them on earth who will tell them that people had no faith in Our revelations
On the day when We resurrect from every nation a group from among those who had rejected Our revelations they will be kept confined in ranks
When they will be brought into the presence of God He will ask them Did you reject My revelations without fully understanding them
What did you know about them if you had any knowledge at all
They will become subject to punishment because of their injustice
Thus they will not speak
Have they not seen that We have created the night for them to rest and the day for them to see
In this there is evidence for the believing people
Everyone in the heavens and earth will be terrified on the day when the trumpet will be sounded except those whom God will save Everyone will humbly come into the presence of God
You think the mountains are solid In fact they move like clouds
It is God s technique which has established everything perfectly
He is well Aware of what you do
Whoever does a good deed will receive a better reward than what he has done
He will be secure from the terror of the Day of Judgment
Those who commit evil will be thrown headlong into hell fire
It will be said to them can you expect any recompense other than what you deserve for your deeds
I am commanded to worship the Lord of this town which He has made sacred To Him belong all things I am commanded to be a Muslim
and recite the Quran
Whoever seeks guidance will find it for his own soul
Say to whoever goes astray I am only a warner
Say It is only He who deserves all praise
He will soon show you His signs and you will recognize them
Your Lord is not unaware of what you do
Sin Mim
These are the verses of the illustrious Book
We recite to you some of the story of Moses and the Pharaoh for a genuine purpose and for the benefit of the believing people
The Pharaoh dominated the land and divided its inhabitants into different groups suppressing one group by killing their sons and keeping their women alive
He was certainly an evildoer
But We have decided to grant a favor to the suppressed ones by appointing them leaders and heirs of the land
give them power in the land and make the Pharaoh Haman his Minister and their armies to experience from their victims what they feared most
We inspired Moses mother saying Breastfeed your son
When you become afraid for his life throw him into the sea
Do not be afraid or grieved for We shall return him to you and make him a Messenger
The people of the Pharaoh picked him up without realizing that he would become their enemy and a source of their sorrow The Pharaoh Haman and their army were sinful people
The Pharaoh s wife said He Moses is the delight of our eyes
Do not kill him
Perhaps he will benefit us or we may adopt him
They were unaware of the future
The heart of Moses mother was relieved and confident
But she would almost have made the whole matter public had We not strengthened her heart with faith
She told Moses sister to follow her brother
His sister watched him from one side and the people of the Pharaoh did not notice her presence
We had decreed that the infant must not be breastfed by any nurse besides his mother
His sister said to the people of the Pharaoh May I show you a family who can nurse him for you with kindness
Thus did We return Moses to his mother that We would delight her eyes relieve her sorrows and let her know that the promise of God was true but many people do not know
When he become matured and grow to manhood We granted him wisdom and knowledge
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He entered the city without the knowledge of its inhabitants and found two men fighting each other
One was his follower and the other his enemy
His follower asked him for help
Moses struck his enemy to death but later said It was the work of satan he is the sworn enemy of the human being and wants to mislead him
Moses said Lord I have wronged myself
Forgive me
The Lord forgave him He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
He said Lord in appreciation for Your favor to me I shall never support the criminals
He remained in the city but very afraid and cautious
Suddenly the person who asked him for help the previous day asked him for help again
Moses said You are certainly a mischievous person
When Moses was about to attack their enemy he said Moses do you want to kill me as you slew a soul the other day
Do you want to become a tyrant in the land not a reformer
A man came running from the farthest part of the city saying Moses people are planning to kill you I sincerely advise you to leave the city
So he left the city afraid and cautious saying Lord protect me against the unjust people
When he started his journey to Midian he said Perhaps my Lord will show me the right path
When he arrived at the well of Midian he found some people watering their sheep and two women keeping the sheep away from the others
He asked the two women What is the matter with you
They replied We cannot water our sheep until all the shepherds have driven away their flocks Our father is an old man
Moses watered their flocks and then sought shelter under a shadow praying Lord I need the means to preserve the power that You have granted me
One of the women walking bashfully came to Moses and said My father calls you and wants to pay you for your watering our flocks
When Moses came to the woman s father and told him his whole story he said Do not be afraid
Now you are secure from the unjust people
One of the women said to her father Father hire him the best whom you may hire is a strong and trustworthy one
He Shu ayb said to Moses I want to give one of my daughters to you in marriage on the condition that you will work for me for eight years but you may continue for two more years only out of your own accord
I do not want it to become a burden for you
God willing you will find me a righteous person
Moses said Let it be a binding contract between us and I shall be free to serve for any of the said terms God will bear witness to our agreement
When Moses completed the term of the contract and departed from his employer with his family he saw a fire on his way on one side of the Mount Sinai
He asked his wife Stay here
I can see some fire
Perhaps I will be able to bring some news of it or some fire for you to warmup yourselves
He was called from a tree of the blessed spot of the bank of the right side of the valley when he appraoched it Moses I am God the Lord of the Universe
Throw down your staff
When Moses saw his staff moving on the ground like a living being he fled with no desire to step forward
He was told Moses step forward
Do not be afraid you will be safe and secure
Place your hand in your pocket it will come out sheer white but not sick Be humble for fear of God and show these two miracles of your Lord to the Pharaoh and his officials they are an evildoing people
Moses said Lord I have killed a man from their people and I am afraid that they will kill me
My brother Aaron is more fluent then I am
Send him with me to assist me and express my truthfulness I am afraid they will reject me
The Lord said We will support you by your brother and will grant you such prestige that no one will dare to approach anyone of you
By the help of Our miracles both you and your follower will certainly triumph
When Moses came to them with Our miracles they said These are only invented magic
We have never heard of such things from our fathers
Moses said My Lord knows best who has received guidance from Him and who will achieve a happy end
The unjust ones certainly will have no happiness
The Pharaoh said My people I know no one who could be your lord besides myself Haman construct for me a tower of baked bricks so that I may climb on it and see the God of Moses I think he is a liar
The Pharaoh and his army were puffedup with pride in the land for no true cause They thought that they would never return to Us
We sized him and his army and threw them into the sea
See how terrible was the end of the unjust people
We made them the kinds of leaders who would invite people to the fire and who would receive no help on the Day of Judgment
We made them to be mentioned with condemnation in this life and they will be disgraced on the Day of Judgment
After destroying the people of the ancient towns We gave the Book to Moses to be a source of knowledge a guidance and mercy for mankind so that perhaps they would take heed
Muhammad you were not present at the west bank to witness when We gave the commandments to Moses
But We raised many generations after Moses and they lived for many years You did not dwell with the people of Midian reciting Our revelations to them but We had certainly sent Messengers to them
You had not been present at the side of the Mount Sinai when We called Moses from the tree but through Our mercy we told you his story so that you might warn the people
to whom no warner had been sent that perhaps they might take heed and that on experiencing afflictions because of their own deeds they may not say Lord would that You had sent to us a Messenger so that we could follow Your revelations and become believers
When the Truth from Us came to them they said Would that he Muhammad had received what was given to Moses by his Lord
Did not they reject what Moses had brought to them saying These two Moses and Aaron are two magicians who support each other We do not have any faith in them
Muhammad tell them Bring a Book if you are able to from God better in its guidance than the Torah and the Quran I shall follow it
If they cannot meet such a challenge know that they are only following their evil desires
Who strays more than one who follows his desires without guidance from God
God does not guide the unjust people
We sent Our guidance to them so that perhaps they might take heed
Some of the followers of the Bible believe in the Quran
When it is recited to them they say We believe in it
It is the Truth from our Lord
We were Muslims before it was revealed
These will receive double reward for their forbearance replacing evil by virtue and for their spending for the cause of God
When they hear impious words they ignore them saying We shall be responsible for our deeds and you will be responsible for yours
Peace be with you
We do not want to become ignorant
Muhammad you cannot guide whomever you love but God guides whomever He wants and knows best those who seek guidance
They the pagans say If we were to follow your guidance we would be snatched away from our land
Have We not given them the secure holy precinct wherein all types of fruits are brought to them as a sustenance from Us
However many of them do not know it
How many nations who had enjoyed great prosperity had We destroyed
Those are their homes which were not inhabited thereafter except for a short time
Only We were their heirs
Your Lord did not destroy the people of the towns without first sending a Messenger to the mother town who would recite His revelations to them
We did not want to destroy the towns if the people therein were not unjust
Whatever you people have been given are only the means for enjoyment and beauty of the worldly life but the means of enjoyment which you will receive from God in the life to come will be better and everlasting
Will you then not take heed
Is the case of those to whom We have promised good things which they will certainly receive in the life to come equal to the case of those to whom We have granted the means of enjoyment in the worldly life and who will certainly be questioned about them in the life to come
On the day when He will ask the latter group Where are those whom you had considered equal to Me
Those who have become subject to punishment will say Lord they seduced us Their idols will say We seduced them but we renounce their worshipping us for it was not us whom they worshipped
They will be told to call their idols
They will call them but will receive no answer
They will see the torment approaching and wish that they had sought guidance
On the day when God will call them and ask them What answer did you give to Our messengers
The door to all answers will be closed to them and they will not even be able to ask one another
However those who have repented and have become righteously striving believers will perhaps have everlasting happiness
Your Lord creates and chooses to grant mercy to whomever He wants
In matters of guidance they unbelievers do not have the choice to choose whatever they want
God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Your Lord knows all that their hearts hide or reveal
He is the only God and it is only He who deserves to be given thanks in this world and in the life to come Judgment is in His hands and to Him you will all return
Muhammad ask them Think if God were to cause the night to continue until the Day of Judgment which Lord besides Him could bring you light
Will you then not listen to His revelations
Say Do you not think that if God were to cause the day to continue until the Day of Judgment which Lord besides Him could bring you the night to rest Do you not see His signs
He has made the night and day for you to rest as a mercy to you and seek His favor and that perhaps you will give Him thanks
God will call the unbelievers on the Day of Judgment and ask them Where are your idols in which you had faith
We shall call from every nation a witness and shall ask them to bring proof in support of their belief
They will know that truth belongs to God and that whatever they had falsely invented has abandoned them
Korah was a man from the people of Moses
This man rebelled against them We had given him so much treasure that the keys of the stores of his treasures could hardly even be carried by a group of strong people
His people told him Do not be proud of your wealth God does not love those who are proudly happy of their wealth
Seek the gains of the life to come through your wealth without ignoring your share of this life Do favors to others just as God has done favors to you Do not commit evil in the land for God does not love the evildoers
He said I have received this wealth because of my knowledge
Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations that lived before him who were stronger than him in power and people
There will be no need to ask the criminals what sins they have committed for the angels already know them
Korah would bedeck himself to show off his wealth Those who wanted worldly gains would say Would that we were given that which Korah has received
He has certainly received a great share
The people who had received knowledge would tell them Woe to you
The reward of God is far better for the righteously striving believers
No one can receive such reward except those who exercise patience
We caused the earth to swallow up him and his home No one besides God could help him nor could he himself achieve victory
The people who the other day had wished to be like him began saying Woe to us
God gives abundant wealth only to those of His servants whom He wants and He determines everyone s share
Had it not been for God s favor to us He would have caused the earth to swallow us up
Woe to the unbelievers who will have no happiness
There is the life hereafter which We have prepared for those who do not want to impose their superiority over the others in the land nor commit evil therein
The happy end certainly belongs to the pious ones
The reward for a good deed will be greater than the deed itself and the recompense for an evil deed will be equivalent to the deed
Muhammad God Who has commanded you to follow the guidance of the Quran will certainly return you victoriously to your place of birth
Say My Lord knows best who has brought guidance and who is in plain error
You had no hope of receiving the Book except by the mercy of your Lord Do not be a supporter of the unbelievers
Let them not prevent you from following the revelations of God after they are revealed to you
Call mankind to your Lord and do not be a pagan
Do not worship anything besides God
He is the only God
Everything will be destroyed except God
To Him belongs Judgment and to Him you will all return
Alif Lam
Do people think they will not be tested because they say We have faith
We had certainly tried those who lived before them to make sure who were truthful in their faith and who were liars
Do the evildoers think they can escape Us
How terrible is their judgment
Let those who have the desire to be in the presence of God on the Day of Judgment know that their day will certainly be coming
God is AllHearing and AllKnowing
Whoever strives hard should know that it is for his own good
God is independent of the whole world
We shall expiate the sins of the righteously striving believers and shall reward them better than their deeds
We have advised the human being Be kind to your parents
Do not obey them if they force you to consider equal to Me things which you do not know are such
You will all return to Me and I shall show all that you have done
We shall admit the righteously striving believers into the company of the pious ones
Some people say We have faith in God But when they face some hardship for His cause they begin to consider the persecution that they have experienced from people as a torment from God
When your Lord grants you a victory they say We were with you
Does God not know best what is in the hearts of every creature
God certainly knows all about the believers and the hypocrites
The unbelievers say to the believers Follow our way
We shall take the responsibility for your sins
They cannot take responsibility for any of the sins
They are only liars
Besides the other burdens that they will have to carry they will certainly be loaded with the burden of their own sins
They will be questioned on the Day of Judgment about what they had falsely invented
We sent Noah to his people and he lived with them for nine hundred and fifty years then the flood engulfed them for their injustice
We saved Noah and the people in the Ark and made their case a miracle for the world
Abraham told his people Worship God and have fear of Him
It is better for you if only you knew it
You worship idols besides God and you create falsehood
Whatever you worship besides Him cannot provide you with anything for your sustenance
Seek your sustenance from the bounties of God
Worship Him Give Him thanks
To Him you will all return
If you pagans call our revelations lies certainly many generations living before you have also done the same thing
The duty of a Messenger is only to preach clearly
Have they not seen how God begins the creation and then turns it back This is not difficult at all for God
Muhammad say to them Travel through the land and see how He has begun the creation and how He will invent the next life God has power over all things
He punishes or grants mercy to whomever He wants and to Him you will all return
You cannot challenge God in the heavens or in the earth
No one besides God is your guardian or helper
Those who have rejected God s revelations have no hope in receiving His mercy
They will face a painful torment
Abraham s people had no answer except suggesting Kill him or burn him
But God saved him from the fire
In this there is evidence of truth for the believing people
Abraham said You believe in idols besides God only out of worldly love but on the Day of Judgment you will reject and condemn each other
Your dwelling will be fire and no one will help you
Only Lot believed in Abraham and said I seek refuge in my Lord for He is Majestic and Allwise
We granted Isaac and Jacob to Abraham and We bestowed upon his offspring prophethood and the Book
We gave him his reward in this world and in the next life he will be among the pious ones
Lot told his people You are certainly committing the kind of indecency which no one in the world has committed before
Do you engage in carnal relations with men rob the travellers and commit evil in your gatherings
His people had no answer but to say Bring upon us the torment of God if you are truthful
He prayed Lord help me against the evildoing people
When Our angelic Messengers brought glad news to Abraham they told him We are about to destroy the people of this town for their injustice
Abraham said Lot is there in that town
They said We know everyone there
We shall certainly save him and his family except his wife who will remain behind
When Our angelic Messengers came to Lot he was grieved and depressed to see them
They told him Do not be afraid or grieved
We will rescue you and your family except your wife who will remain behind
We will bring torment from the sky on this town because of the evildeeds of its inhabitants
We left manifest evidence of the truth there for the people of understanding
We sent to the people of Midian their brother Shuayb
He told them Worship God
Have hope in the life to come
Do not spread evil in the land
They rejected him so We jolted them with a violent earthquake and they were left motionless in their houses
How the people of Ad and Thamud were destroyed is evident to you from their homes
Satan made their deeds seem attractive to them and prevented them from the right path even though they had visions
Korah the Pharaoh and Haman were also destroyed
Moses had brought them illustrious miracles but they were puffedup with pride in the land and they could not defeat Us
We punished all of these people because of their sin
Some of them were struck by a violent sandstorm some by a blast of sound others were swallowed up by the earth and some were drowned in the sea
God did not do injustice to them but they had wronged themselves
The belief of considering other things as one s guardians besides God is as feeble as a spider s web The spider s web is the frailest of all dwellings if only they knew it
God knows whatever they worship besides Him He is the Majestic and Allwise
These are parables which We tell to human being but only the learned ones understand them
God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believers
Muhammad recite to them what has been revealed to you in the Book and be steadfast in prayer prayer keeps one away from indecency and evil
It is the greatest act of worshipping God
God knows what you do
Do not argue with the People of the Book except only by the best manner except the unjust among them
Tell them We believe in what is revealed to us and to you
Our Lord and your Lord is one
We have submitted ourselves to His will
We have revealed the Book to you
Some of the People of the Book and some of the pagans also believe in it
No one rejects Our revelations except the infidels
You were not able to read or write before the Quran was revealed to you otherwise the followers of falsehood would have tried to confuse the matter
In fact the Quran consists of illustrious verses that exist in the hearts of those who have knowledge
No one rejects Our revelations except the unjust ones
They say Why a miracle is not sent to him from his Lord
Say Miracles are in the hands of God
I am simply a warner
Is it not enough for them that We have revealed the Book to you to be recited to them
It is a mercy and a reminder for the believers
Say God is sufficient as a witness between me and you
He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
Those who have faith in falsehood and disbelieve in God are certainly lost
They demand you to bring upon them torment immediately
Had not the time been fixed the torment would certainly have approached them
It would have come to them suddenly and they would not have even realized how it came
They demand you to bring upon them the torment immediately
Hell will certainly engulf the unbelievers
They will be told on the Day of Judgment when the torment will surround them from all sides Suffer the consequences of your deeds
My believing servants My land is vast Worship Me alone
Every soul will experience the agony of death and to Me you will all return
We shall give mansions in Paradise wherein streams flow to the righteously striving believers and therein they will live forever
How blessed is the reward of the hard working people
who have exercised patience and who have had trust in their Lord
There are many living creatures which do not carry their sustenance but God provides them and you with sustenance He is Allhearing and Allknowing
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth and has subdued the sun and moon They will say God has done it
So why are they wandering about
God increases the sustenance of whichever of His servants He wants and He determines their share
God has the knowledge of all things
If you ask them Who has sent down water from the sky to revive the dead earth
They will say God has done it
Say It is only God who deserves all praise but many of them do not understand
The worldly life is not more than a childish game
It is the life hereafter which will be the real life if only they knew it
When they sail in a boat they sincerely pray to God with pure faith
But when We bring them safely to land they start considering things equal to God
Let them be ungrateful to what We have granted them Let them enjoy themselves but they will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Have the pagans not seen that We have made the holy precinct a safe place while all the people around are suffering terror
Do they believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God s bounties
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or rejects the Truth after it has come to him
Is not hell the dwelling for the disbelievers
We shall certainly guide those who strive for Our cause to Our path
God is certainly with the righteous ones
Alif Lam
The Romans have been defeated in a nearby land and after this defeat
within a few years they will be victorious
All matters of the past and future are in the hands of God
The believers will enjoy the help of God on that Day
He helps whomever He wants
He is Majestic and Allmerciful
This is the promise of God
God does not ignore His promise but many people do not know
They only know the superficial realities of the worldly life and they are unaware of the life to come
Have they not thought that God has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but for a genuine purpose to exist for an appointed term
Many people do not believe in their meeting with their Lord
Have they not travelled through the land to see how terrible was the end of the people who lived before them
The people who lived before them were stronger than them in might in tilling and in developing the earth
Our Messengers came to them with clear miracles
God did not do an injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The end of the evildoers was terrible for they had rejected the revelations of God and mocked them
God begins the creation then causes it to turn back and to Him you will all return
On the day when the Hour of Doom comes the criminals will despair
None of the idols will intercede for them and they will reject their idols
When that day comes people will be separated from one another
The righteously striving believers will happily live in paradise
However the disbelievers who called Our revelations and the Day of Judgment lies will be brought into torment
Glory belongs to God all the time in the evening and in the morning
To Him belongs all the thanks giving which takes place in the heavens and the earth in the evenings and the noontime
He brings forth the living from the dead takes out the dead from the living and revives the earth from its death
Thus you will all be brought back to life again
Some evidence of His existence are His creating you from clay and from that you became human beings scattered all around
His creating spouses for you out of yourselves so that you might take comfort in them and His creating love and mercy among you
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people who carefully think
Other evidence of His existence are the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences of languages and colors
In this there is evidence of the truth for the worlds mankind
Your sleeping during the night and in the day your seeking His favors are evidence of the truth for the people who have hearing
Also of the evidence of His existence are His showing you lightening which gives you fear and hope and His sending water down from the sky which revives the earth after its death
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
Some other evidence of His existence is that both the heavens and the earth stand firm at His command When He will call you from the earth you will start to come out
Everyone in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him and is subservient to Him
It is He who begins the creation then turns it back
For Him this is very easy
All the exalted attributes in the heavens and the earth belong to Him
He is the Majestic and Allwise
God has told you this parable about yourselves Could your slaves share your wealth equally with you and could you fear them as you fear yourselves Thus do We clarify the evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
In fact the unjust have followed their desires without knowledge
Who will guide those whom God has caused to go astray
No one will be their helper
Muhammad be devoted to the upright religion
It is harmonious with the nature which God has designed for people
The design of God cannot be altered
Thus is the upright religion but many people do not know
Turn in repentance to Him
Have fear of Him
Be steadfast in your prayer Do not be like the pagans
who have divided themselves into various religious sects each one happy with their own belief
When people face hardship they begin praying to their Lord and turn in repentance to Him
When they receive mercy from Him a group of them begin to consider things equal to God
because of their ingratitude for what We have given them
Let them enjoy themselves but they will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Have We sent them any authority to speak in support of their idols
When people receive mercy they are happy with it
However when hardship befalls them because of their own deeds they despair
Have they not seen how God increases the livelihood of whomever He wants and determines his share
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
Give the relatives the destitute and the needy travellers their share of charity
It is better for those who want to please God and they will have everlasting happiness
God will not allow to increase whatever illegal interest you try to receive in order to increase your wealth at the expense of people s property
Whatever amount of zakat you give to please God will be doubled for you
It is God who has created you and given you sustenance
He will make you die and will bring you back to life
Can any of your idols do such things
God is too Exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Evil has spread over the land and the sea because of human deeds and through these God will cause some people to suffer so that perhaps they will return to Him
Muhammad tell them Travel through the land to see how terrible was the end of those who lived before
Many of them were pagans
Be devoted to the upright religion before the coming of the inevitable day when no one can escape from God and people will either be sent to Paradise or hell
Those who disbelieve do so against their own souls
Those who do good pave the way for their own benefit
God will reward the righteously striving believers through His favor
He does not love the unbelievers
Some evidence of His existence is His sending the gladnewsbearing winds so that He would let you to receive His mercy cause the ships to sail by His command and let you seek His favor so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Muhammad We had sent before you Our Messengers to their people
The Messengers showed them clear miracles and We took revenge on the criminals
It was necessary for Us to help the believers
It is God who sends the winds to raise the clouds He spreads them in the sky as He wants then He intensifies them and then you can see the rain coming down from the cloud
When He sends it down upon whichever of His servants He wants they rejoice
at the rainfall though before that they had been in despair
Look at the traces of the mercy of God how He has revived the dead earth
God revives the dead He has power over all things
Even if We had sent the wind and caused the plants to turn yellow and to fade away they would still have remained in disbelief
You cannot make the dead listen nor the deaf hear Thus they the disbelievers turn away on their heels
You cannot guide the straying blind
You can make no one listen except those who believe in Our revelations and are Muslims
It is God who has created you weak then given you strength after your weakness and caused you to become weak and old after being strong
He creates whatever He wants
He is Allknowing and Allpowerful
On the day when the Hour of Doom comes the criminals will swear that they have remained in their graves for no more than an hour They had been inventing lies in this way
Those who have received knowledge and have faith will say By the decree of God you have remained for the exact period which was mentioned in the Book of God about the Day of Resurrection
This is the Day of Resurrection but you did not know
The excuses of the unjust on this day will be of no avail to them and they will not be able to please God
We have told people various parables in this Quran
Even if you had shown them a miracle the unbelievers would have said You are only the followers of falsehood
Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know
Be patient
The promise of God is certainly true
Let not the faithless make you despair of the promise of God
Alif Lam
These are the verses of the Book of wisdom
A guidance and mercy for the righteous
people who are steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax and have firm belief in the life to come
They follow the guidance of their Lord and they will have everlasting happiness
In an attempt to show that God s revelations are only ancient legends some people pay for meaningless tales to draw others attention away from the Quran without knowledge and treat as a matter of fun
They will suffer a humiliating torment
When Our revelations are recited to them they turn back on their heels out of pride as if they did not hear them or their ears had been sealed off
Warn them of the painful torment
The righteously striving believers will enter Paradise
wherein they will live forever
It is the true promise of God
He is Majestic and Allwise
He has created the heavens without pillar as you can see fixed the mountains on earth so that it may not shake you away and settled therein all types of living creatures
We have sent down water from the sky and made all kinds of plants grow in gracious pairs
This is the creation of God
Show me what those whom you consider equal to God have created
In fact the unjust ones are in plain error
We gave wisdom to Luqman so that he would give thanks to God
Those who give thanks to God do so for their own good
Those who are ungrateful should know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Luqman advised his son telling him My son do not consider anything equal to God for it is the greatest injustice
Concerning his parents We advised the man whose mother bears him with great pain and breastfeeds him for two years to give thanks to Me first and then to them to Me all things proceed
If they try to force you to consider things equal to Me which you cannot justify equal to Me do not obey them
Maintain lawful relations with them in this world and follow the path of those who turn in repentance to Me
To Me you will all return and I shall tell you all that you have done
My son God keeps the records of all the good and evil deeds even if they are as small as a grain of mustard seed hidden in a rock or in the heavens or the earth
God is subtle and Allaware
My son be steadfast in prayer Make others do good
Prevent them from doing evil Be patient in hardship
Patience comes from faith and determination
Do not scornfully turn your face away from people
Do not walk around puffedup with pride God does not love arrogant and boastful people
Be moderate in your walking and your talking
The most unpleasant sound is the braying of donkeys
Have you not seen that God has made all that is in the heavens and the earth subservient to you human beings and has extended and perfected for you His apparent and unseen bounties
Some people argue about God without knowledge guidance or an enlightening book
When they are told to follow what God has revealed to them they say We shall only follow our father s way of life
Will they follow it even if it is Satan who is calling them to the burning torment
Whoever submits himself to the will of God in righteousness has certainly achieved a stronghold
The end of all things is in the hands of God
Muhammad do not let the disbelievers grieve you
To Us they will all return and We shall tell them all about what they have done
God knows best what is in everyone s hearts
We shall allow them to enjoy themselves for a short while then force them into severe torment
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth they will certainly say God has created them
Say It is only God who deserves all praise but most of them do not know
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
If all the trees in the earth were pens and the ocean with seven more oceans were ink still these could not suffice to record all the Words of God
God is Majestic and Allwise
For God your creation and your resurrection are only like the creation and resurrection of one soul
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Have you not seen that God causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night He has made the sun and moon subservient to Himself
Each moves in an orbit for an appointed time
God is certainly Allaware of what you do
This is because God is the supreme Truth and whatever they worship besides Him is falsehood
God is the Most High and the Most Great
Have you not seen that the ships sail in the ocean through the bounty of God so that He may show you the evidence of His existence
There is evidence of the truth in this for every forbearing and grateful one
When the waves cover them like shadows they pray to God with sincerity in their religion but when We bring them safely to land only some of them follow the right path
No one rejects Our revelations except the treacherous ungrateful ones
Mankind have fear of your Lord and the day when a father will be of no avail to his son nor will a son carry any part of the burden of his father The promise of God is true Do not let the worldly life deceive you nor let your pride deceive you about God
Only God has the knowledge of the coming of the Hour of Doom
He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs No soul is aware of what it will achieve tomorrow and no soul knows in which land it will die
God is Allknowing and Allaware
Alif Lam
There is no doubt that this Book is revealed by the Lord of the Universe
Do they say that he Muhammad has invented it
No it is the truth from your Lord so that you will warn the people who have not received a warning before you
Perhaps they will seek guidance
God is the one who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then He established His dominion over the Throne
No one besides Him is your guardian or intercessor
Will you then not take heed
He sends the regulation of the affair from the heavens to the earth then on the day which is equal to one thousand years of yours it will ascend to Him
He knows the unseen and the seen He is Majestic and Allmerciful
It is He Who created everything in the best manner and began the creation of the human being from clay
He made His offspring come into existence from an extract of insignificant fluid
then He gave it proper shape and blew His spirit in it
He made ears eyes and hearts for you but you give Him very little thanks
They have said How can we be brought to life again after we have been lost in the earth
In fact they have no faith in the Day of Judgment
Muhammad say The angel of death who is appointed over everyone of you will cause you to die and to your Lord you will all return
Would that you could see on the Day of Judgment that criminals with their heads hanging down before their Lord saying Our Lord we have seen and heard
Send us back to act righteously
Now we have strong faith
Had We wanted We could have given guidance to every soul but My decree that hell will be filledup with jinn and people has already been executed
They will be told Suffer on this Day of Judgment
For your having ignored it We have ignored you
Suffer everlasting torment for your evil deeds
The only people who believe in Our revelations are those who when reminded about them bow down in prostration and glorify their Lord with His praise without pride
Their sides giveup rest in beds in order to pray before their Lord in fear and hope They spend for the cause of God out of what we have given them
No soul knows what delight awaits them as the reward for their deeds
Is a believer equal to an evildoer
They are not equal at all
The righteously striving believers will have Paradise for their dwelling as the reward of their good deeds
However the dwelling of the sinful ones will be hell fire
Each time they try to come out they will be turned back with this remark Suffer the torment of the fire which you had called a lie
We shall certainly make them suffer worldly torment before suffering the great torment so that perhaps they may return to Us
Who are more unjust than those who are reminded of the revelation of their Lord but have ignored them
We will take revenge on the criminal
We gave the Book to Moses do not have any doubt about the Day of Judgment and made it a guide for the children of Israel
We appointed some of the Israelites as leaders for their exercising patience to guide the others to Our commands They had firm belief in Our revelations
Your Lord will issue His decree about their believers and disbeliever s differences on the Day of Judgment
Was it not a lesson for them the unbelievers that We destroyed the many generations living before them among whose ruined dwellings they are now walking
In this there is many evidence of the truth
Will they not then listen
Have they not seen that We drive the water to the barren land and cause crops to grow which they and their cattle consume
Why then they will not see
They say If what you say is true when will the final triumph come
Say On the day of the final triumph the faith of the disbelievers will be of no avail to them nor will they be given any respite
Turn away from them and wait They are also waiting
Prophet have fear of God and do not yield to the infidels and hypocrites
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord
God is Allaware of what you do
Trust in God and be sure that He is a Sufficient Guardian
God has not created two hearts inside any one human being
God does not consider your wives whom you renounce by zihar as your mothers nor those whom you adopt as your sons
These are only words of your mouth
God tells the Truth and shows the right path
Call them sons of their own fathers
It is more just in the eyes of God
If you do not know their fathers they are your brothers and friends in religion
You will not be responsible for your mistakes but you will be responsible for what you do intentionally
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The Prophet has more authority over the believers than themselves
His wives are their mothers
The relatives are closer to each other according to the Book of God than the believers and the emigrants
However you may show kindness to your guardians
This also is written in the Book
We had a solemn covenant with you Muhammad and the Prophets Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus the son of Mary
This was a firm agreement God will ask the truthful ones about their truthfulness and prepare a painful torment for the disbelievers
Believers recall God s favor to you when the army attacked you
We sent a wind and the armies which you did not see to support you
God sees all that you do
Eyes became dull and hearts almost reached the throat when they attacked you from above and below and you started to think of God with suspicion
There the believers were tested and tremendously shaken
It was there that the hypocrites and those whose hearts were sick said The promise of God and His Messenger has proved to be nothing but deceit
It was there that a group of them said People of Yathrib turn back for there is no place for you to stay
Another group asking for the Prophet s permission said Our homes are defenseless
In fact they were not defenseless
They only wanted to run away
Had the army of the enemies invaded their homes and asked them to giveup their religion they would have yielded to them without delay
They had certainly promised God that they would not turn away
To promise God is certainly a great responsibility
Muhammad tell them Running away will never be of any benefit to you even if you run away from death or being killed Still you would not be able to enjoy yourselves except for a short while
Say Who can prevent God from punishing you or granting you mercy
They will not find anyone besides God as their guardian or helper
God certainly knows those among you who create obstacles on the way that leads to God and those who say to their brothers Come quickly to us and very rarely take part in the fighting
They are niggardly in spending for you
When fear comes you can see them looking at you their eyes rolling about like to faint because of the agony of death
When their fear subsides they start to bite you with their sharp tongues They are miserly in spending for a virtuous cause and have no faith
God has turned their deeds devoid of all virtue
This was not at all difficult for God
They think that the confederate tribes have not yet gone
If the confederate tribes were to attack them they would have wished to be left alone among the bedouin Arabs where they would only follow the news about you
Even if they were with you only a few of them would take part in the fight
The Messenger of God is certainly a good example for those of you who have hope in God and in the Day of Judgment and who remember God very often
On seeing the confederate tribes the believers said This is what God and His Messenger had promised us
The promise of God and His Messenger is true
This only strengthens their faith and their desire of submission to the will of God
Among the believers there are people who are true in their promise to God
Some of them have already passed away and some of them are waiting
They never yield to any change
God will certainly reward the truthful ones for their truthfulness and punish or pardon the hypocrites as He wishes
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God repelled the unbelievers in their rage
They could not achieve anything good
God rendered sufficient support to the believers in fighting
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
God brought down those among the People of the Book who had supported the confederate tribes from their castles and struck their hearts with terror
You did away with some of them and captured the others
God made you inherit their land houses property and a land on which you had never walked
God has power over all things
Prophet tell your wives If you want the worldly life and its beauty I shall allow you to enjoy it and set you free in an honorable manner
but if you want the pleasure of God His Messenger and the life hereafter know that God has prepared a great reward for the righteous ones among you
Wives of the Prophet if anyone among you commits indecency her torment will be double
This is not at all difficult for God
To whoever of you obeys God and His Messenger and acts righteously We will give double reward and a honorable sustenance
Wives of the Prophet you are not like other women If you have fear of God do not be tender in your speech lest people whose hearts are sick may lust after you
Do not display yourselves after the manner of the preIslamic age of darkness
Be steadfast in the prayer pay the religious tax and obey God and His Messenger
People of the house God wants to remove all kinds of uncleanliness from you and to purify you thoroughly
Wives of the Prophet remember the revelations of God and Words of wisdom that are recited in your homes
God is Most Kind and Allaware
God has promised forgiveness and great rewards to the Muslim men and the Muslim women the believing men and the believing women the obedient men and the obedient women the truthful men and the truthful women the forbearing men and the forbearing women the humble men and the humble women the almsgiving men and the almsgiving women the fasting men and the fasting women the chaste men and the chaste women and the men and women who remember God very often
The believing men and women must not feel free to do something in their affairs other than that which has been already decided for them by God and His Messenger
One who disobeys God and His Messenger is in plain error
Say to the person to whom you and God have granted favor Keep your wife and have fear of God
You hide within yourself what God wants to make public
You are afraid of people while it is God whom one should fear When Zayd set her free We gave her in marriage to you so that the believers would not face difficulties about the wives of their adopted sons when they are divorced
God s decree has already been issued
The Prophet cannot be blamed for carrying out the commands of God
It was the tradition of God with those who lived before
The command of God has already been decreed and ordained
Those who preach the message of God and are humble before Him should not be afraid of anyone besides God
God is Sufficient in keeping the account
Muhammad is not the father of any of your males
He is the Messenger of God and the last Prophet
God has the knowledge of all things
Believers remember God very often
and glorify Him both in the mornings and in the evenings
It is He who forgives you and His angels pray for you so that He will take you out of darkness into light
God is Allmerciful to the believers
On the day when they will be brought into the presence of their Lord their greeting to each other will be Peace be with you
God has prepared an honorable reward for them
Prophet We have sent you as a witness a bearer of glad news a warner
a preacher for God by His permission and as a shining torch
Give glad news to the believers of their receiving great favor from God
Do not yield to the disbelievers or the hypocrites
Ignore their annoying you Trust in God
God is your all Sufficient Protector
Believers if you marry believing women and then divorce them before the consummation of the marriage they do not have to observe the waiting period Give them their provisions and set them free in an honorable manner
Prophet We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowry slave girls whom God has given to you as gifts the daughters of your uncles and aunts both paternal and maternal who have migrated with you The believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet may want to marry will be specially for him not for other believers
We knew what to make obligatory for them concerning their wives and slave girls so that you would face no hardship because we have given distinction to you over the believers
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
You may refuse whichever of the woman who offer themselves to you as you want and accept whichever of them you wish
There is no blame on you if you marry one whom you had refused previously
This would be more delightful for them They should not be grieved but should be happy with whatever you have given to every one of them
God knows what is in your hearts
God is Allknowing and Allforbearing
Besides these other women are not lawful for you to marry nor is it lawful for you to exchange your wives for the wives of others except for the slave girls even though they may seem attractive to you
God is watchful over all things
Believers do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without permission if you are invited you may enter but be punctual so that you will not be waiting while the meal is being prepared
When you have finished eating leave his home Do not sit around chatting among yourselves
This will annoy the Prophet but he will feel embarrassed to tell you
God does not feel embarrassed to tell you the truth
When you want to ask something from the wives of the Prophet ask them from behind the curtain
This would be more proper for you and for them
You are not supposed to trouble the Prophet or to ever marry his wives after his death for this would be a grave offense in the sight of God
Whether you reveal something or hid it God has the knowledge of all things
It will not be an offense for the wives of the Prophet not to observe the modest dress in the presence of their fathers sons brothers sons of their brothers and sisters their own women and their slavegirls
They should have fear of God
God witness all things
God showers His blessings upon the Prophet and the angels seek forgiveness for him
Believers pray for the Prophet and greet him with Peace be with you
Those who annoy God and His Messenger will be condemned by God in this life and in the life to come He has prepared for them a humiliating torment
Those who annoy the believing men and women without reason will bear the sin for a false accusation a manifest offense
Prophet tell your wives daughters and the wives of the believers to cover their bosoms and breasts
This will make them distinguishable from others and protect them from being annoyed
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If the hypocrites those whose hearts are sick and those who encourage the spread of evil in the city will not desist We shall arouse you against them and they will only be allowed to be your neighbors for a short while
They will be condemned wherever they are and will be sized and done away with for good
This was the tradition of God with those who lived before
There will never be any change in the tradition of God
Muhammad people ask you about the Day of Judgment
Say Only God has knowledge about it
Perhaps the Hour of Doom will soon come to pass
God has condemned the unbelievers and prepared for them a burning torment
wherein they will live forever without being able to find any guardian or helper
On the day when their faces will be turned from side to side on the fire they will say Would that we had obeyed God and the Messenger
They will say Lord we obeyed our chiefs and elders and they caused us to go astray
Lord make them to suffer double torment and subject them to the greatest condemnation
Believers do not be like those who annoyed Moses
God proved him to be innocent of what they had said about him
Moses was a honorable person in the sight of God
Believers have fear of God and speak righteous words
God will reform your deeds and forgive your sins
One who obeys God and His Messenger will certainly achieve a great success
We offered Our Trust Our deputation to the heavens to the earth and to the mountains but they could not bear this burden and were afraid to accept it Mankind was able to accept this offer but he was unjust to himself and ignorant of the significance of this Trust
As a result of this God will punish the hypocrites and the pagans but He will accept the repentance of the believers
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
It is only God who deserves all praise
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and it is only He who deserves to be praised in the life to come He is Allwise and Allaware
He knows all that enters the earth all that comes out of it all that descends from the sky and all that ascends to it
He is Allmerciful and Allforgiving
The disbelievers have said There will be no Hour of Doom
Say By my Lord it certainly will come My Lord knows the unseen
Not even an atom s weight in the heavens or the earth remains hidden from Him
Nothing exists greater or smaller than this without its record in the illustrious Book
God will certainly reward the righteously striving believers
These are the ones who will receive forgiveness and honorable sustenance
However those who try to challenge Our revelations will face the most painful torment
Those who have been given knowledge will see that whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth and that it guides to the straight path of the Majestic and Praiseworthy One
The unbelievers have said Should we tell you about a man who says that you will be brought back to life again after your having been completely disintegrated
Has he invented this falsehood against God or is he possessed by jinn
However those who do not have any faith in the life to come will suffer torment for their serious error
Have they not seen the heavens and the earth in front and behind them
Had We wanted We could have caused the earth to swallow them up or made a part of the sky fall upon them
In this there is evidence of the truth for every repenting person
We granted David a favor by commanding the mountains and birds to sing Our praise along with him and softened iron for him
so that he could make coats of mail and properly measure their rings
We told him and his people to act righteously
We are WellAware of what you do
We made subservient to Solomon the wind that travelled a month s journey in the morning and a month s journey in the evening
We made a stream of brass flow for him and some of the jinn worked for him by his Lord s command
We would make whichever of them jinn who turned away from Our command to suffer a burning torment
They would make for him anything that he wanted like fortresses statues large basins like reservoirs and huge immovable cooking pots
It was said Family of David worship and act gratefully
Only few of my servants are grateful
When We decreed that Solomon should die no one knew of his death except for a creeping creature of the earth who ateup his staff
When he fell down the jinn realized that if they had known about the unseen they would not have remained in such a humiliating torment for so long
There was evidence of the truth for the people of Sheba in their homeland
We gave them two gardens one on the left and one on the right and told them Consume the sustenance which your Lord has given to you and give Him thanks
You have a blessed land and an Allforgiving Lord
They ignored the evidence and We sent to them a flood arising from a broken dam
Nothing was left in their gardens but bitter fruits some tamarisk and a few lotus trees
This was how We recompensed them for their ungratefulness and thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
We established between them and the town that We had blessed other towns nearby and thus made it easier to travel
We told them Travel there safely day and night
They said Lord make the distances of our journeys longer
They did injustice to themselves and We turned their existence into ancient tales by making them disintegrate totally
In this there is evidence of the truth for every forbearing and grateful person
Iblis satan made his judgment about them to come true
They all followed them except a believing group among them
He did not have any authority over them except to the extent that would allow Us to know who had faith in the life to come and who had doubts about it
Your Lord is a Guard over all things
Say Muhammad Ask help from those whom you worship besides God
They do not possess an atom s weight in the heavens and the earth have no share therein nor will any of their idols be able to support them
No intercession with Him will be of any benefit except that of those whom He has granted permission
The angels cannot intercede They are always submissive to their Lord
Fear vanishes from their heart when they receive a message from their Lord They ask each other What did your Lord say
Others answer He spoke the Truth
He is the Most High and the Most Great
Say Who provides you with sustenance from the heavens and the earth Say It is God
Only one group among us has the true guidance
The others must certainly be in plain error
Say You will not be questioned about our sins nor shall we about your deeds
Say Our Lord will gather us all together and issue the true Judgment about our differences
He is the Best Judge and Allknowing
Say Show me those whom you have related to God as His partner
He is too Exalted to have any partners
He is the Majestic and Allwise God
We have sent you as a bearer of glad news and a warner to the whole of mankind but most people do not know
They say When will the Day of Judgment be if what you say is true
Say That day has already been decreed for you and you cannot change the time of its coming even by a single hour
The unbelievers have said We shall never believe in this Quran nor in the Bible
Would that you could see the unjust having been halted in the presence of their Lord exchanging words among themselves The oppressed among them will say to their oppressors Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers
The suppressing ones will say to the oppressed ones Did we prevent you from having guidance after it had come to you
In fact you yourselves were criminals
The oppressed ones will say to them It was you who planned night and day ordering us to disbelieve God and consider other things equal to Him
They will hide their regret on seeing their torment
We shall chain the necks of the disbelievers
Can they be recompensed with other than what they deserved for their deeds
Every time We sent a warner to a town the rich ones therein said to Our Messenger We have no faith in what you have brought to us
We are the ones who have more wealth and children and we shall suffer no punishment
Say My Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants but most people do not know
Your property and children cannot bring you closer to Us
Only those who believe and act righteously will have double reward for their deeds and will live in secure mansions
Those who try to challenge Our revelations will be driven into torment
Say It is my Lord who determines and increases the sustenance of whomever He wants
He will replace whatever you spend for His cause and He is the best Sustainer
On the day when God will rise them all together and ask the angels Had these people been worshipping you
They will reply All glory belongs to you
You are our guardian not they
They had been worshipping the jinn and most of them had strong faith
None of them can help or harm each other on this day
We shall tell the unjust ones Suffer the torment of the fire which you had called a lie
When Our illustrious revelations are recited to them they say This man only wants to prevent you from worshipping what your father s had worshipped They say This the Quran is a mere invented lie
The unbelievers have said about the truth when it came to them This only is plain magic
We did not send to them the pagans any books to study nor a Messenger to warn them and those who lived before them had rejected the Truth
These people have not one tenth of power or wealth that we had given to those who lived before them They called Our Messengers liars Thus how terrible was My vengeance
Say I advise you to believe only in One God and worship Him individually or two people together Think carefully your companion is not possessed by jinn
He is only warning you of the coming severe torment
Say Whatever reward I ask you for my preaching will be for your own good
No one can reward me except God
He is the Witness over all things
Say My Lord speaks the Truth
He has the knowledge of the unseen
Say The truth has come
Falsehood has vanished and it will not come back again
Say If I go astray it will only be against my own soul but if I receive guidance it will be through my Lord s revelations
He is Allhearing and Omnipresent
Would that you could see how the unbelievers will be terrified by death from which they cannot escape
They will be seized from a nearby place
and then they will say We have faith in the Quran
How can they have any faith when they are far away from this world
They had rejected it in their worldly life and expressed disbelief at the unseen Day of Judgment considering it less than a remote possibility
A gulf will exist between them and their desires on the Day of Judgment like the similar people who lived before
They too had lived in doubt and uncertainty about the life hereafter
All praise belongs to God the creator of the heavens and the earth who has made the angels Messengers of two or three or four wings
He increases the creation as He wills
God has power over all things
No one can withhold whatever mercy God grants to the human being nor can one release whatever He withholds
He is Majestic and Allwise
People remember the bounty of God that He has granted to you
Is their any creator besides God who could provide you with sustenance from the heavens and the earth
He is the only God
Where then can you turn away
If they reject you other Messengers had certainly been rejected before you
All decisions are in the hands of God
People the promise of God is true
Let not the worldly life deceive you
Let not the devil deceive you about God
Satan is your enemy Thus consider him as your enemy
His party only calls you to make you the dwellers of the burning fire
The unbelievers will suffer a severe torment but the righteously striving believers will receive forgiveness and a great reward
Can one whose evil deeds seem attractive and virtuous to him be compared to a truly righteous person
God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
Muhammad do not be grieved because of their disbelief
God knows well whatever they do
It is God who sends the winds to raise the clouds
We then drive them unto barren areas and revive the dead earth
The Resurrection will also be executed in the same way
Whoever seeks honor should know that all honor belongs to God
Good words worship will be presented before Him and He will accept good deeds
Those who make evil plans will suffer intense torment
Their evil plans are doomed to destruction
God created you from clay which He then turned into a living germ and made you into pairs
No female conceives or delivers without His knowledge
No one grows older nor can anything be reduced from one s life without having its record in the Book
This is not at all difficult for God
The two oceans one sweet and the other salty are not alike
From each you can eat fresh meat and obtain ornaments to use
You see ships ploughing their way through them so that you may seek His favor and give Him thanks
He causes the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night
He has made subservient to Himself the sun and moon each moving in an orbit for an appointed time
Such is God your Lord to whom belongs the kingdom
Those whom you worship besides Him do not posses even a single straw
They will not listen to your prayers if you pray to them Even if they would listen they would not be able to answer you
On the Day of Judgment they will reject your worship of them
Not even an expert reporter can tell you the truth in the way that God can do
People you are always in need of God and God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
He could replace you by a new creation if He decided to
This would not cost God dear at all
No one will bear the burden of another
Even if an overburdened soul should ask another to bear a part of his burden no one not even a relative will do so
Muhammad you can only warn those who have fear of their Lord without seeing Him and who are steadfast in prayer
Whoever purifies himself does so for his own good
To God do all things return
The blind and the seeing are not alike
nor are darkness and light
nor shade and heat
nor are the living and the dead
God makes to listen whomever He wants
Muhammad you cannot make people in the graves to listen
You are simply a warner
We have sent you in all truth as a bearer of glad news and a warner
No nation who lived before was left without a warner
If they reject you know that others who lived before them had also rejected their Messengers Messengers who had brought them miracles scriptures and the enlightening Book
so I seized the unbelievers and how terrible was their torment
Have you not seen that God has sent water down from the sky has produced fruits of various colors and has made streaks of various colors in the mountains white red and intense black
He has also created people beasts and cattle of various colors
Only God s knowledgeable servants fear Him
God is Majestic and Allpardoning
Those who recite the Book of God who are steadfast in prayer and who spend out of what We have given them for the cause of God both in public and in private have hope in an indestructible bargain
and in receiving their reward from God and in further favors
He is Allforgiving and Allappreciating
Whatever We have revealed to you from the Book is all truth It confirms what was revealed before
God sees His servants and is Allaware of them
We gave the Book as an inheritance to Our chosen servants among whom some are unjust against their souls some are moderate and some are exceedingly virtuous by the permission of God
This is indeed a great favor
They will enter the gardens of Eden wherein they will be decked with bracelets of gold pearls and silk garments
They will say It is only God who deserves all praise He has removed all of our suffering
Our Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allappreciating
It is He who has granted us through His favor an everlasting dwelling wherein we shall experience no hardship nor any fatigue
The unbelievers will dwell in hell
It will not be decreed for them to die nor will their torment be relieved
Thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
Therein they will cryout Lord take us out of here
We shall act righteously and behave different to what we did before
They will be told Did We not allow you to live long enough for you to seek guidance
Did We not send a warner to you
Suffer the torment
There is no one to help the unjust
God has knowledge of whatever is unseen in the heavens and the earth
He knows best what the hearts contain
It is He who has made you each other s successors on earth
Whoever disbelieves does so against his own self
The disbelief of the unbelievers will only increase the anger of their Lord and will only cause them greater loss
Muhammad ask them Think about the idols which you worship besides God Show me what part of the earth they have created
Do they have any share in the heavens
Has God sent them a Book to confirm their authority
In fact whatever the unjust promise each other is nothing but deceit
God prevents the heavens and the earth from falling apart
If they do fall apart then no one besides Him can restore them
He is Allforbearing and Allforgiving
They solemnly swear that if a warner were to come to them they would certainly have been better guided than any other nation
But when a warner came to them it only increased their hatred
because of their pride in the land and their evil plots
Evil plots only affect the plotters
Do they expect anything other than God s tradition torment with those who lived before You will never find any change in the tradition of God nor will you find any alteration in it
Have they not travelled sufficiently through the land to see how terrible was the end of the mightier people who lived before them
Nothing in the heavens or the earth can challenge God
God is Allknowing and Allpowerful
Were God to punish people for their deeds immediately not one creature would have survived on earth
However He has given them a respite for an appointed time and when their term comes to an end let it be known that God watches over His servants
I swear by Ya Sin
and the Quran the Book of wisdom
that you Muhammad are a Messenger
and that you follow the right path
This is a revelation sent down from the Majestic and Allmerciful
so that you may warn a people who are unaware because their fathers were not warned
I swear that most of them are doomed to be punished
They have no faith
We have enchained their necks up to their chins Thus they cannot bend their heads to find their way
We have setup a barrier in front of and behind them and have made them blind
Thus they cannot see
Whether you warn them or not they will not believe
You should only warn those who follow the Quran and have fear of the Beneficent God without seeing Him
Give them the glad news of their receiving forgiveness and an honorable reward from God
It is We who bring the dead to life and records the deeds of human beings and their consequences of continual effects
We keep everything recorded in an illustrious Book
Tell them the story of the people of the town to whom Messengers came
We sent them two Messengers whom they rejected
We supported them by sending a third one who told the people We are the Messengers of God who have been sent to you
The people said You are mere mortals like us and the Beneficent God has sent nothing You are only liars
They said Our Lord knows that We are Messengers
who have been sent to you Our only duty is to preach clearly to you
The people said We have ill omens about you
If you will not desist we shall stone you and make you suffer a painful torment
The Messengers said This ill omen lies within yourselves
Will you then take heed
In fact you are a transgressing people
A man came running from the farthest part of the city saying My people follow the Messengers
Follow those who do not ask you for any reward and who are rightly guided
Why should I not worship God who has created me
To him you will all return
Should I worship other gods besides Him
If the Beneficent God was to afflict me with hardship the intercession of the idols can be of no benefit to me nor could it rescue me from hardship
Had I worshipped things besides God I would have been in manifest error
Messengers listen to me
I believe in your Lord
Having been murdered by the disbelievers he was told to enter paradise
wherein he said Would that people knew how my Lord has granted me forgiveness and honor
We did not send an army against his people from the heaven after his death nor did We need to send one
It was only a single blast which made them extinct
Woe to human beings
Whenever a Messenger came to them they mocked him
Have they not seen how many generations living before them had We destroyed and they cannot ever come back to them
They will all be brought into Our presence together
Evidence of the truth for them is how We revived the dead earth
and produced therein grains from which they eat and established therein gardens of palms trees and vineyards and have made streams flow therein
so that they may consume the fruits and whatever their hands prepare
Will they not then be grateful
All glory belongs to the One Who has created pairs out of what grow from the earth out of their soul and out of that which they do not know
Of the signs for them is how We separated the day from the night and thus they remained in darkness
how the sun moves in its orbit and this is the decree of the Majestic and Allknowing God
how We ordained the moon to pass through certain phases until it seems eventually to be like a bent twig
how the sun is not supposed to catchup with the moon nor is the night to precede the day All of them are to float in a certain orbit
how We carried them and their offspring inside the laden Ark
and created for them similar things to ride
Had We wanted We could have drowned them and nothing would have been able to help or rescue them
except Our mercy which could enable them to enjoy themselves for an appointed time
Whenever they are told to guard themselves against sin and the forth coming torment so that perhaps they could receive mercy
and whenever a revelation out of their Lord s revelations comes to them they ignore it
When they are told to spend for the cause of God out of what He has provided for them for their sustenance the disbelievers say to the believers Should we feed those whom God has decided to feed
You are in plain error
The unbelievers say When will the Day of Judgment come if what you say is at all true
They will not have to wait long When the Day of Judgment comes it will only take a single blast of sound to strike them while they are quarrelling with one another
Then they will not be able to make a will or return to their families
When the trumpet is sounded they will be driven out of their grave into the presence of their Lord
They will say Woe to us
Who has raised us up from our graves
This is what the Beneficent God has promised
The Messengers have also spoke the truth
Only after a single blast of sound they will all be brought into Our presence
No soul will be in the least bit wronged on that Day and no one will receive any recompense other than what he deserves for his deeds
The dwellers of Paradise on that day will enjoy themselves
They and their spouses will recline on couches in the shade therein
They will have fruits and whatever they desire
Peace be with you will be a greeting for them from the Merciful Lord
The Lord will command Criminals stand away from the others on this day
Children of Adam did We not command you not to worship satan He was your sworn enemy
Did We not command you to worship Me and tell you that this is the straight path
Satan misled a great multitude of you
Did you not have any understanding
This is hell with which you were threatened
Suffer therein on this day for your disbelief
We shall seal your mouths on that Day let your hands speak to us and your feet testify to what you had achieved
We could have blinded them had We wanted Then they would have raced along to cross the Bridge but how could they have seen their way
We could have turned them into other creatures on the spot had We wanted and they would not have been able to precede or turn back
The physical growth of those whom We grant a long life will be reversed
Will you then not understand
We did not teach him Muhammad poetry nor was he supposed to be a poet
It is only the word of God and the illustrious Quran
by which he may warn those who are living and may let the words of God come true against the unbelievers
Have they not seen what We have created from the labor of Our own hands We have given them cattle
We have made the cattle subservient to them so they ride and consume them
From cattle they get milk and other benefits
Will they not then give thanks
They chose idols besides God in the hope of receiving help from them but they will not be able to help them
Instead the disbelievers will be brought into the presence of God as the soldiers of the idols
Muhammad let not their words annoy you
We certainly know whatever they conceal or reveal
Has the human being not considered that We have created him from a drop of fluid He is openly quarrelsome
He questions Our Resurrection of him but has forgotten his own creation He has said Who will give life to the bones which have become ashes
Muhammad tell him He who gave them life in the first place will bring them back to life again
He has the best knowledge of all creatures
He has created fire for you out of the green tree from which you can kindle other fires
Is the One who has created the heavens and the earth not able to create another creature like the human being
He certainly has the power to do so
He is the Supreme Creator and is Allknowing
Whenever He decides to create something He has only to say Exist and it comes into existence
All glory belongs to the One in whose hands is the control of all things
To Him you will all return
I swear by the angels who stand in ranks
by those who drive away the devil to protect Our revelation
and those who recite Our revelations
that your Lord is the only Lord
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the Lord of the Eastern regions
We have decked the lower heavens with stars
to protect them from the rebellious satan
The devils cannot hear those high above They would be struck from all sides
and driven away to suffer the necessary torment
Some of them who stealthily steal words from the heavens are pursued by a glistening flame
Muhammad ask them Have they people been created stronger than what We have created
We have created them from moist clay
Muhammad you will be surprised that they still mock God s revelations
They pay no attention when they are reminded
and when they see a miracle they mock
it and say It is only plain magic
They say Shall we be brought to life again after we die and turn into dust and bones
Will our forefathers also be brought to life again
Say You will certainly be brought back to life in disgrace
The Day of Judgment will come within a single roar and they will remain gazing at it
They will say Woe to us
They will be told This is the day of receiving recompense
This is the Day of Judgment in which you disbelieved
God will command the angels Gather together the unjust their spouses and what they had worshipped
besides God and show them the way of hell
Stop them They must be questioned
They will be asked Why do you not help each other
In fact on that day they will be submissive
They will turn to each other saying
It was you who tried to mislead us from righteousness
Others will respond It was you who did not want to have any faith
We had no authority over you in fact you were a rebellious people
Thus the words of Our Lord about us have come true and now we are suffering the torment
We mislead you and we ourselves had also gone astray
On that day they will all share the torment
This is how We deal with the criminals
They were the ones who on being told God is only One become puffedup with pride
and said Should we give up our idols for the sake of an insane poet
In fact he had brought them the truth and had acknowledged the Messengers who were sent before him
They will be told You will certainly suffer the painful torment
and will be recompensed only for what you deserve
But the sincere servants of God
will have their determined sustenance
and fruits while they are honored
They will live in the bountiful gardens
on couches facing each other
They will be served with a cup full of crystal clear wine
delicious to those who drink it
but not harmful or intoxicating
They will have with them loving wives with big black and white eyes
who are as chaste as sheltered eggs
They will turn to each other and ask questions
One of them will say I had a companion who asked me
Do you believe in the Day of Judgment
Shall we be recompensed for our deeds after we die and become bones and dust
Do you want to see him
He will look down and see him in hell
He will say to his friend in hell By God you almost destroyed me
Had I not the guidance of my Lord I would certainly have been brought into torment
He will ask his companion Did you not say that there would only be one death
and that we would not be punished
This is certainly the greatest triumph
for which one must strive hard
Is this not a better reward than the tree of Zaqqum
which We have made as a torment for the unjust
Zaqqum is a tree which grows from the deepest part of hell
and its fruits are like the heads of devils
The dwellers of hell will eat that fruit and fillup their bellies
Then they will have on top of it a mixture of boiling water
They can only return to hell
They found their father going astray
and rushed to follow them
Most of the ancient people had also gone astray
We had certainly sent warners to them
See how terrible was the end of those who were warned
Only Our sincere servants were saved
Noah called for help How blessed was the answer which he received
We rescued him and his people from the greatest affliction
and We made his offspring the only survivors
We perpetuated his praise in later generations
Peace be with Noah among all men in the worlds
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
We drowned all the others besides Noah and his people
Abraham was one of his followers
He turned to his Lord with a sound heart
and asked his father and his people What is that you worship
Do you want to worship false idols as your lords besides God
What do you think about the Lord of the Universe
The people invited him to attend their feast Then he looked at the stars
and said I am sick
All the people turned away from him
and he turned to their idols and asked them Do you eat
Why do you not speak
He struck them with his right hand
Thereupon the people came running to him
He said How can you worship what you yourselves have carved
even though God created both you and that which you have made
They said Let us build a fire and throw him into the flames
They plotted against him but We brought humiliation upon them
Abraham said I will go to my Lord who will guide me
Abraham prayed Lord grant me a righteous son
We gave him the glad news of the birth of a forbearing son
When his son was old enough to work with him he said My son I have had a dream that I must sacrifice you
What do you think of this
He replied Father fulfill whatever you are commanded to do and you will find me patient by the will of God
When they both agreed and Abraham had lain down his son on the side of his face for slaughtering
We called to him Abraham
you have fulfilled what you were commanded to do in your dream
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
It was certainly an open trial
We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice
and perpetuated his praise in later generations
Peace be with Abraham
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
We gave him the glad news of the birth of Isaac one of the righteous Prophets
We had blessed him and Isaac
Some of their offspring were righteous and others were openly unjust to themselves
We certainly bestowed Our favor upon Moses and Aaron
and saved them and their people from great distress
We helped them and they were victorious
We gave them the enlightening Book
guided them to the right path
and perpetuated their praise in later generations
Peace be with Moses and Aaron
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
They were two of Our believing servants
Elias was certainly a Messenger
He told his people Why do you not have fear of God
Do you worship Baal and abandon the Best Creator
who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
They called him a liar Thus all of them will suffer torment
except the sincere servants of God
We perpetuated his praise in the later generations
Peace be with the followers of Elias
In this way do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
Lot was certainly a Messenger
We rescued him and his whole family
except for an old woman who remained behind
Then We totally destroyed the others
You pass by their ruined town in the morning and at night
Will you then not understand
Jonah was certainly a Messenger
He abandoned his people
and sailed away in a laden ship wherein people cast lots
Because he lost he was thrown into the water
The fish swallowed him up and he deserved all this
Had he not glorified God
he would certainly have remained inside the fish until the Day of Resurrection
We cast him out of the fish unto dry land and he was sick
We made a plant of gourd grow up for him
We sent him to a hundred thousand or more people
They believed in him so We granted them enjoyment for an appointed time
Muhammad ask them Do daughters belong to your Lord and sons to them
Have We created the angels as females before their very eyes
It is only because of their false invention that they say
God has begotten a son
They are certainly liars
Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
Woe to you How terrible is your Judgment
Do you not understand
Do you have clear authority
Bring your book if what you say is true
They have said that there is a relationship between Him and the jinn
The jinn certainly know that they will all be brought to suffer torment
God is too glorious to be described as they describe Him
except the servants of God sincere and devoted
You and whatever you worship
cannot mislead anyone
except those who are doomed to enter hell
The angels say Each of us has an appointed place
We stand in ranks for prayer
and we glorify God
Even though they unbelievers say
Had we received guidance from the people living before us
we would have certainly been sincere servants of God
They have rejected the Quran
They will soon know the consequences of their disbelief
We decreed that Our Messenger servants
will certainly be victorious
and that Our army will be triumphant
Muhammad stay away from them for a while
and watch them
They too will watch
Do they want to suffer Our torment immediately
When it descends into their courtyard it will be terrible for those who have already been warned
Stay away from them for a while
and watch
They too will watch
Your Lord the Lord of Honor is too exalted to be considered as they describe Him
Peace be with the Messengers of God
It is only God the Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Sad
I swear by the Quran which is full of reminders of God that you are a Messenger
In fact the unbelievers are the ones who are boastful and quarrelsome
How many ancient generations did We destroy
On facing Our torment they cried out for help but it was too late for them to escape
It seems strange to the pagans that a man from their own people should come to them as a Prophet The unbelievers have said He is only a lying magician
They say Has he condemned all other gods but One
This is certainly strange
A group of the pagans walked out of a meeting with the Prophet and told the others Let us walk away Be steadfast in the worship of your gods
This man wants to dominate you
We have heard nothing like this in the latest religion
This is only his own false invention
Can it be that he alone has received the Quran
In fact they have doubts about My Quran and this is because they have not yet faced My torment
Do they possess the treasures of the mercy of your Muhammad s Lord the Majestic and Munificent God
Do they own the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
Let them try on their own to block the ways of heavens so that Our revelations cannot come to you
They are only a small band among the defeated confederate tribes
The people of Noah Ad and the dominating Pharaoh had rejected Our revelations
So also did the people of Thamud Lot and the dwellers of the Forest
Each of them who rejected the Messenger become subject to Our punishment
They had only to wait for the single inevitable blast
They scornfully said Lord show us the record of our deeds before the day when everyone must present the account of their deeds
Muhammad bear patiently what they say and recall Our servant David who had strong hands and who was most repentant
We made the mountains join him in glorifying Us in the evening and in the morning
We made the birds assemble around him in flocks
We strengthened his kingdom giving him wisdom and the power of sound Judgment
Have you heard the news of the disputing parties who climbed the walls of the prayer room
and entered where David was praying He was frightened so they said Do not be afraid
We are only two disputing parties of which one of us has transgressed against the other
Judge between us with truth and justice and guide us to the right path
One of them said This is my brother who has ninetynine ewes when I have only one
He has demanded me to place that one in his custody he had the stronger argument
David said He has certainly been unjust in demanding your ewe from you
Most partners transgress against each other except for the righteously striving believers who are very few
David realized that it was a test from Us so he asked forgiveness from his Lord and knelt down before him in repentance
We forgave him for this
In Our eyes he certainly has a good position and the best share of the world to come
We told him
David We have appointed you as Our deputy on earth so judge among the people with truth
Do not follow worldly desires lest you go astray from the way of God
Those who go astray from the way of God will suffer severe torment for forgetting the Day of Reckoning
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without purpose even though this is the belief of the disbelievers
Woe to the disbelievers they will suffer the torment of fire
Do We consider the righteously striving believers equal to the evildoers in the land
Are the pious ones equal to those who openly commit sin
It is a blessed Book which We have revealed for you so that you will reflect upon its verses and so the people of understanding will take heed
We granted Solomon to David a blessed servant of Ours and certainly the most repentant person
When the noble galloping horses were displayed to him one evening
he said My love of horses for the cause of God has made me continue watching them until sunset thus making me miss my prayer
He said Bring them back to me
Then he started to rub their legs and necks
We tested Solomon by causing death to his son and leaving his body on Solomon s chair
Then he turned to Us in repentance
saying Lord forgive me and grant me a kingdom that no one after me can have the like You are Allmunificent
We made the wind subservient to him to blow gently wherever he desired at his command
and all the devils who built and dived for him
The rest of the devils were bound in chains
We told him This is Our gift to you so give them away free or keep them as you like
In Our eyes he certainly has a high position and the best place to return
Muhammad recall Our servant Job
When he prayed to his Lord saying Satan has afflicted me with hardship and torment
We answered his prayer healed his sickness and told him Run on your feet
This is cool water for you to wash and drink
We gave him back his family and doubled their number as a blessing from Us and as a reminder to the people of understanding
We told him Take a handful of straw
Strike your wife with it to fulfill your oath
We found him to be patient
What an excellent servant he was
He was certainly most repenting
Muhammad recall Our servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob all of whom possessed virtuous hands and clear visions
We gave them this pure distinction because of their continual remembrance of the Day of Judgment
In Our eyes they were of the chosen virtuous people
Recall Ismael Elisha and Dhulkifl Ezekiel who were all virtuous people
Such is their noble story
The pious ones will certainly have the best place to return
They will enter gardens of Eden with their gates open for them
They will be resting therein and will be able to ask for many kinds of fruit and drink
They will have bashful wives of equal age with them
This is what they had been promised for the Day of Judgment
Our provision for you will never be exhausted
However the rebellious ones will have the worst place to return
They will suffer in hell
What a terrible dwelling
They will be told This is your recompense
Taste the scalding water pus and other putrid things
Their leaders will be told This band will also be thrown headlong with you into hell
Their leaders will exclaim May condemnation fall upon them
Let them suffer the torment of fire
Their followers will say In fact it is you who deserve condemnation
It was you who led us to hell a terrible dwelling
They will continue saying Lord double the torment of fire for those who led us into this
But why is it that we cannot see men whom we had considered as wicked
and whom we mocked
Have they been rescued or can our eyes not find them
Such disputes will certainly take place among the dwellers of hell fire
Muhammad say I am only a warner
The only Lord is God the Almighty
He is the Lord of the heavens the earth and all that is between them the Majestic and Allforgiving
Say It facts about the supremacy of God is the greatest message
but you have turned away from it
I have no knowledge of the dispute among the angels concerning their attitude towards Adam
I have only received revelation to give you plain warning
When your Lord told the angels I will create a mortal out of clay
and when I give it proper shape and blow My spirit into it bow down in prostration to him
all the angel then prostrated themselves
except Iblis who puffed himself up with pride and became a disbeliever
The Lord said Iblis what prevented you from prostrating before what I have created with My own hands
Was it because of your pride or are you truly exalted
He said I am better than him
You have created me from fire and him out of clay
The Lord said Get out of here
You deserve to be stoned
My condemnation will be with you until the Day of Judgment
He said Lord grant me respite until the Day of Resurrection
The Lord said You will only be given a respite
for an appointed time
He said By Your Glory I shall seduce all of them children of Adam
except Your sincere servants among them
The Lord said I swear by the Truth and I speak the Truth
that I shall certainly fill hell with you and your followers all together
Muhammad say I do not ask any reward for my preaching to you for I am not a pretender
It the Quran is nothing but a reminder to you from the Lord of the Universe
You will certainly know its truthfulness after a certain time
This Book is a revelation from God the Majestic and AllWise
We have revealed the Book to you in all truth Worship God and be devoted to His religion
The religion of God is certainly pure
Concerning those whom they consider as their guardians besides God they say We only worship them so that they may make our positions nearer to God
God will certainly issue His decree about their differences
God does not guide the liars and the disbelievers
Had God wanted to have a son He would have chosen one from His creatures according to His will
God is too Exalted to have a son
He is One and Almighty
He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
He covers the night with the day and the day with the night and has subdued the sun and the moon each of which floats for an appointed time
God is certainly Majestic and AllForgiving
He has created you from a single soul
Out of this He created your spouse
He sent you eight pairs of cattle
He creates you for a second time in the wombs of your mothers behind three curtains of darkness
He is your Lord to whom belongs the Kingdom
He is the only Lord
Where then will you turn away
If you disbelieve know that God is certainly independent of you
He does not want disbelief for His servants
If you give thanks He will accept it from you
No one will be responsible for the sins of others
To your Lord you will all return and He will tell you about what you have done
He knows best what the hearts contain
When the human being is afflicted with hardship he starts to pray to his Lord and turns to Him in repentance
When God grants him a favor he forgets the hardship about which he had prayed to God and starts to consider equal to God things that lead him astray from His path
Muhammad tell him You can only enjoy in your disbelief for a short time
You will certainly be a dweller of hell fire
Can this one be considered equal to one who worships God during the night prostrating and standing who has fear of the Day of Judgment and who has hope in the mercy of his Lord
Say Are those who know equal to those who do not know
Only the people of reason take heed
Say to My believing servants Have fear of your Lord
Those who act righteously in this life will receive good reward
The land of God is vast
God will recompense the deeds of those who have exercised patience without keeping an account
Say I am commanded to worship God and be devoted to His religion
and I am commanded to be the first Muslim
Say I am afraid that for disobeying my Lord I shall suffer the torment of the great day
Say I worship God alone and devote myself to His religion
Worship besides Him whatever you want
The greatest losers are those whose souls and family members will be lost on the Day of Judgment for this is certainly a great loss
Above and below them their will be shadows of fire
This is how God frightens His servants
My servants have fear of Me
Those who have avoided worshipping idols and have turned in repentance to God will receive the glad news
Muhammad give the glad news to those of Our servants who listen to the words and only follow the best ones
Tell them that they are those whom God has guided
They are the people of understanding
How can you rescue the one who is destined to suffer the torment
Those who have fear of their Lord will have lofty mansions built upon mansions beneath which streams flow
It is the promise of God
God does not disregard His promise
Have you not seen that God has sent down water from the sky and made it flow as springs out of the earth
He makes crops of different colors grow with this water and flourish which then turn yellow and wither away
In this there is a reminder for the people of understanding
One whose chest heart and mind is left open for Islam submission to His will shall receive light from God
Woe to those whose hearts have become like stone against the remembrance of God
They are clearly in error
God has revealed the best reading material in the form of a Book with similar passages which refer to each other and make the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver
Then their skins and hearts incline to the remembrance of God
This is the guidance of God
He guides whomever He wants
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray
Is there anyone who is afraid of the torment of the Day of Judgment when the unjust will be told Suffer the result of your deeds
Those who lived before them had also rejected Our revelations
Thus the torment struck them and they did not even realize where it came from
God made them suffer humiliation in this life
Would that they knew that the torment for them in the next life will be even greater
We have given all kinds of examples for the human being in this Quran so that perhaps he may take heed
This Quran is a flawless reading text in the Arabic language Perhaps they will have fear of God
God tells a parable in which there is a company of quarrelsome people and only one of them is well disciplined
Can they be considered as equal
It is only God who deserves all praise
In fact most of them do not know
Muhammad you will die and all of them will also die
Then on the Day of Judgment all of you will present your disputes before your Lord
Who is more unjust then one who invents falsehood against God and rejects the truth after it has come to them
Is not hell a dwelling for the disbelievers
Those who have brought the truth and have acknowledged it are those who have fear of God
They will receive whatever they want from their Lord
Thus is the reward of the righteous ones
God will certainly expiate their bad deeds and reward them much more for what they have done
Is God not sufficient support for His servants
They frighten you with what they worship besides God
Who can guide one whom God has caused to go astray
Who can mislead one whom God has guided
Is God not Majestic and Revengeful
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth
They will certainly say God has created them Ask them Do you think that you can rescue me from the punishment of God with which He may afflict me
Can you prevent His mercy if He wants to grant it to me
Say God is Sufficient support for me
In Him alone one must trust
Say My people act as you wish
I shall do as I like and you will soon know
who will face the humiliating torment and suffer everlasting retribution
Muhammad We have revealed the Book to you for mankind in all truth
Whoever seeks guidance does so for his own good
Whosoever goes astray goes against his own soul
You are not their representative
God will receive their souls when they die Their souls do not die when they are sleeping
During people s sleep He withholds those souls which He has decreed to die and releases the others for an appointed time
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the thoughtful people
Have they chosen intercessors besides God
Say Would you choose them as your intercessors even though they do not possess anything and have no understanding
Say Intercession belongs to God
To Him belongs the heavens and the earth and to Him you will all return
When one God is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment begin to shrink but when the idols are mentioned they rejoice
Say Lord the Creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the seen and unseen it is You who will issue Your decree about the differences of Your servants
Had the unjust possessed double the amount of the wealth of the whole earth they would certainly have liked to offer it on the Day of Resurrection as redemption from the torment of Our scourge when God would make public what they had never expected
Their bad deeds will become public and they will be surrounded by the torment which they had mocked during their worldly life
When the human being is afflicted with hardship he cries out to us for help
When We grant him a favor he says I knew that I deserved it
In fact it is only a test for him but most people do not know this
People who lived before them had also said Our wealth has been earned by our own merits
What they had earned was of no benefit to them
They were afflicted by the terrible result of whatever they gained
Besides this affliction the unjust among them will also suffer the consequence of their deeds
They will not be able to challenge God
Did they not know that God determines and increases the sustenance of whomever He wants
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
Muhammad tell my servants who have committed injustice to themselves Do not despair of the mercy of God
God certainly forgives all sins
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Turn in repentance to your Lord and submit to His will before you are afflicted with the torment after which you can receive no help
Follow the best of what is revealed to you from your Lord before the torment suddenly approaches you and you will not realize how it came about
Turn to God in repentance before a soul says Woe to me because of my failure to fulfill my duties to God
Woe to me for mocking God s guidance
Or before the soul says Had God guided me I could have been a pious man
Or on seeing the torment it would say Would I have the opportunity this time I would certainly become a pious person
God will reply to the soul My revelations had certainly come to you but you rejected them You were puffedup with pride and you became an unbeliever
On the Day of Judgment you will see the faces of those who had invented falsehood against God blackened
Is not hell the dwelling of the arrogant ones
God will save the pious ones because of their virtuous deeds
No hardship will touch them nor will they be grieved
God is the Creator and Guardian of all things
In His hands are the keys of the treasuries of the heavens and the earth
Those who reject God s revelations will be lost
Muhammad say Ignorant ones do you command me to worship things other than God
even though God has said It has been revealed to you and to those who lived before you that if you consider other things equal to God your deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and you will certainly be lost
Muhammad You must worship God alone and give Him thanks
They have not paid due respect to God
The whole earth will be gripped in His hands on the Day of Judgment and the heavens will be just like a scroll in His right hand
God is too Glorious and High to be considered equal to their idols
Everyone in the heavens and the earth will faint in terror except for those whom God will save when the trumpet is sounded
They will all stand up and wait when the trumpet sounds for the second time
The Book of Records will be presented and the Prophets and witness will be summoned All will be judged with justice and no wrong will be done to anyone
Every soul will be recompensed for its deeds
God knows best whatever they have done
The disbelievers will be driven to hell in hordes
Its gates will be opened when they are brought nearby and the keepers will ask them Did Messengers from your own people not come to you to recite your Lord s revelations and to warn you about this day
They will reply Yes the Messengers did come to us but the unbelievers were doomed to face the torment
They will be told Enter the gates of hell to live therein forever
What a terrible dwelling for the arrogant ones
The pious ones will be led to Paradise in large groups
Its gates will be opened to them when they are brought nearby and its keepers will say Welcome
Peace be with you
Enter the gates of Paradise to live therein forever
They will say It is only God who deserves all praise He has made His promise come true and has given the earth as an inheritance to us
Now we live in the gardens as we wished Blessed is the reward of those who labor
Muhammad on that day you will see the angels circling around the Throne glorifying and praising their Lord
Judgment with justice will be decreed between the people of Paradise and hell and it will be said It is only God Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Ha Mim
This Book is a revelation from God the Majestic and Allknowing
who forgives sins who accepts repentance whose punishment is severe and whose bounty is universal
He is the only Lord and to Him all things proceed
No one disputes the revelations of the Lord except the disbelievers
Let not their activities in the land deceive you
The people of Noah who lived before and the Confederate tribes who lived after them rejected Our revelations Every nation schemed against its Messengers to seize them and disputed against them to defeat the truth
But torment struck them and how terrible was their retribution
The word of your Lord that the disbelievers will be the dwellers of hell fire has already been decreed
The bearers of the Throne glorify their Lord with His praise They believe in Him and ask Him to forgive the believers
They say Our Lord Your mercy and knowledge encompass all things
Forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path Lord save them from the torment of hell
Lord admit them and their fathers spouses and offspring who have reformed themselves to the gardens of Eden which You have promised them
You are Majestic and Allwise
Lord keep them away from evil deeds
Whomever You have saved from evil on the Day of Judgment has certainly been granted Your mercy and this is the greatest triumph
The disbelievers will be told God s hatred towards you is much greater than your hatred of your own selves
You were called to the faith but you disbelieved
They say Lord You have caused us to die twice and You have brought us back to life twice We have confessed our sins so is there any way out of this hell
They will be answered Your suffering is only because you disbelieved when One God was mentioned When other things were considered equal to Him you believed in them
Judgment belongs to God the Most High the Most Great
It is He who has shown you the evidence of His existence and has sent you sustenance from the sky yet only those who turn to God in repentance take heed
Worship God and be devoted to His religion even though the disbelievers dislike this
God is the promoter of His servants and the owner of the Throne He sends His spirit by His command to whichever of His servants He wants to warn them of the Day of Judgment
Nothing will remain hidden from God concerning them on the day when they appear before God from their graves It will be asked To whom does the kingdom belong on this Day
It will be answered The kingdom belongs to the Almighty One God
Every soul will be recompensed for its deeds on this Day
There will be no injustice
Certainly God s reckoning is swift
Muhammad warn them of the approaching day when because of hardship and frustration their hearts will almost reach up to their throats
The unjust will have no friends nor any intercessor who will be heard
God knows the disloyalty of the eyes and what the hearts conceal
God judges with Truth but those whom they worship besides God can have no Judgment
God is certainly Allhearing and Allaware
Have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them
They had been mightier than them in power and in leaving their traces on earth
God punished them for their sins
They had no one to save them from God s torment
Messengers had come to them with illustrious miracles but they disbelieved and thus God struck them with His torment
He is Mighty and Severe in His retribution
We sent Moses with Our miracles and clear authority
to the Pharaoh Haman and Korah who said He is only a lying magician
When We sent him to them for a genuine purpose they said Kill the sons of those who have believed in him but keep their women alive
The plots of the unbelievers can only result in failure
The Pharaoh said Let me kill Moses and let him call for help from his Lord
I am afraid that he will change your religion or spread evil through the land
Moses said I seek protection from your and my Lord against every arrogant person who has no faith in the Day of Judgment
A believing person from the people of the Pharaoh who concealed his faith said Would you kill a man just because he says God is my Lord
He has brought you illustrious miracles from your Lord
If he speaks lies it will only harm him but if he speaks the Truth some of his warnings may affect you
God does not guide a transgressing liar
My people today you have the kingdom and the power on earth but who will help us against the wrath of God if it will befall us The Pharaoh said I show you only what I think is proper and guide you only to the right direction
The believing man said I am afraid that you will face a terrible day like that of the groups
people of Noah Ad Thamud and those after them
God did not want injustice for His servants
My people I am afraid for you on the Day of Judgment when people will cry for help
On that day you will run away but no one will be able to protect you from God s Judgment
No one can guide one whom God has caused to go astray
Joseph came to you before with illustrious evidence but you still have doubts about what he brought
When he passed away you said God will never send any Messenger after him
Thus does God causes to go astray the skeptical transgressing people
those who dispute the revelations of God without having received clear authority
This act greatly angers God and the believers
Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor
Pharaoh said Haman build a tower of baked bricks for me so that I shall have access
to the heavens and be able to climb up to the Lord of Moses
I think that Moses is lying
Thus Pharaoh s evil deeds seemed attractive to him and prevented him from the right path
The Pharaoh s plots only led him to his own destructor
The believing man said My people follow me and I shall show you the right guidance
My people this worldly life is only the means to an end but the life hereafter will be the everlasting abode
Whoever commits evil deeds will be recompensed to the same degree
The righteously striving believer male or female will enter Paradise wherein they will receive their sustenance without any account being kept
My people How strange is it that I invite you to salvation when you invite me to the fire
You call me to disbelieve in God and to believe other things equal to Him about which I have no knowledge I call you to the Majestic and Allforgiving One
The idols to which you invite me certainly have no claim to be deities in this world or in the life to come
Our return is to God and the transgressors will be the dwellers of hell fire
You will soon recall what I have told you
I entrust God with my affairs
God is Well Aware of His servants
God protected him against their evil plans and the people of the Pharaoh were struck by the most horrible torment
They will be exposed to the fire in the mornings and the evenings and on the Day of Judgment they will be told People of the Pharaoh suffer the most severe torment
During a dispute in the fire the suppressed ones will say to those who had dominated them We were your followers
Can you now relieve us of our suffering in the fire
The ones who had dominated them will say All of us are now in hell
God has already issued His Judgment of His servants and no one can change this
The dwellers of hell fire will ask its keepers Pray to your Lord to relieve us from the torment at least for one day
The keepers will ask them Did your Messengers not come to you with illustrious evidence of the Truth
They will reply Yes they did
The keepers will then say You may pray but the prayer of the disbelievers will not be answered
We shall help Our Messengers and the believers in this life and on the day when witness will come forward
The excuses of the unjust will be of no benefit to them on that day
They will be condemned to live in a most terrible abode
To Moses We had given guidance and to the children of Israel We had given the Book
as their inheritance and as a guide and a reminder to the people of understanding
Muhammad exercise patience
The promise of God is true
Seek forgiveness for your sins and glorify your Lord with His praise in the evenings and in the early mornings
Those who dispute the revelations of God without having received any authority do so because of their arrogance but their arrogance cannot bring them any success
Seek protection from God for He is Allhearing and Allaware
The creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know
Just as the blind and the seeing are not equal so are the righteously striving believers and the sinners are not equal
How little to this you pay attention
The Hour of Doom will inevitably come but most people do not have faith
Your Lord has said Pray to Me for I shall answer you prayers
Those who are too proud to worship Me will soon go to hell in disgrace
It is God Who has made the night for you to rest and the day for you to see
God is Benevolent to the human being but most people do not give Him due thanks
It is God your Lord Who has created all things
He is the only Lord
Why then do you turn away from His worship to the worshipping of idols
Thus are indeed those who have rejected the revelations of God
It is God who has created the earth as a place for you to live and the sky as a dome above you
He has shaped you in the best form and has provided you with pure sustenance This is God your Lord
Blessed is God the Lord of the Universe
He is the Everlasting and the only Lord
So worship Him and be devoted to His religion
It is only God the Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Muhammad say I have been forbidden to worship whatever you worship besides God after receiving clear evidence from my Lord I have been commanded to submit myself to the will of the Lord of the Universe
It is He Who created you from clay turning it into a living germ then into a clot of blood and then brings you forth as a child
He then made you grow into manhood and become old
He causes some of you to live for the appointed time and some of you to die before so that perhaps you may have understanding
It is He Who gives life and causes things to die
When He decides to do something He only says Exist and it comes into existence
Have you not seen how those who dispute the revelations of God turn away from Truth to falsehood
Those who rejected the Book and the message which was given to Our Messenger will soon know the consequences of their evil deeds
when fetters will be placed around their necks and chains will drag them
into boiling water and then they will be burned in the fire
Then they will be asked Where are the idols which you worshipped besides God
They will reply They have abandoned us
In fact we had worshipped nothing Thus does God cause the disbelievers to go astray
They will be told This torment is the result of your unreasonable happiness on the earth and of your propagation of falsehood
Enter the gates of hell to live therein forever
How terrible is the dwelling of the arrogant ones
Muhammad exercise patience
The promise of God is true
Whether We let you witness the suffering with which they were threatened or because of your death you do not see them suffering We shall still punish them when they return to Us on the Day of Judgment
We have told you the stories of some of Our Messengers whom We had sent before you and We have not told you the stories of some others
A Messenger is not supposed to show a miracle without the permission of God
When God s decree of punishment comes to pass He will judge truthfully and the supporters of the falsehood will perish when God s decree of punishemnt comes to pass
It is God Who has created cattle for you to ride and to consume as food
You may also obtain other benefits from them
You may ride them to seek whatever you need or be carried by them as ships carry you by sea
God shows you the evidence of His existence
How can you then deny such evidence
Have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them
They were far mightier in both number and power and in what they had established
Their worldly gains were of no benefit to them
They were far too content with their own knowledge to pay attention to the Messengers when Our Messengers came to them with illustrious evidence
They were encompassed by the torment for mocking Our guidance
They said We believe in One God and disbelieve in whatever we had considered equal to Him when they experienced Our wrath
Their faith proved to be of no benefit to them when they became subject to Our torment
Such was God s prevailing tradition among His servants in the past
Thus were the unbelievers destroyed
Ha Mim
This is the revelations from the Beneficent Merciful God
The verses of this Book have been fully expounded It is a reading in the Arabic language for the people of knowledge
It contains glad news and warnings for the people but most of them have ignored it and do not listen
They say Our hearts are covered against and our ears are deaf to whatever you Muhammad invite us to
There is a barrier between us and you
So act as you please and we shall act as we please
Muhammad say I am a mere mortal like you
I have received a revelation that your Lord is the only One
So be upright and obedient to Him and seek forgiveness from Him
Woe to the pagans who do not pay zakat and have no faith in the life to come
The righteously striving believers will have a neverending reward
Say Do you really disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two days Do you consider things equal to Him
He is the Lord of the Universe
In four days He placed the mountains on it blessed it and equally measured out sustenance for those who seek sustenance
He established His dominance over the sky which for that time was like smoke
Then He told the heavens and the earth Take your shape either willingly or by force They said We willingly obey
He formed the seven heavens in two days and revealed to each one its task
He decked the sky above the earth with torches and protected it from intruders
Such is the design of the Majestic and Allknowing God
If they ignore your message tell them I have warned you against a destructive blast of sound like that which struck the people of Ad and Thamud
When Messengers from all sides came to them saying Do not worship anything besides God they said Had our Lord wanted He would have sent us angelic Messengers
We do not believe in your message
The people of Ad unjustly sought dominance on earth saying Who is more powerful than us
Did they not consider that God created them and that He is more powerful than they were
They rejected Our revelations
We sent upon them a violent wind during a few illfated days to make them suffer a disgraceful torment in this life
Their torment in the life to come will be even more disgraceful and they will not receive any help
We sent guidance to the people of Thamud but they preferred blindness to guidance so a humiliating blast of torment struck them for their evil deeds
We only rescued the believers who had fear of God
They will be spurred on
until on the brink of it their eyes ears and skin will testify to their deeds on the Day when the enemies of God are driven to the fire
They will ask their own skin Why did you testify against us
They will reply God who has made everything speak made us also speak
It was He Who created you in the first place and to Him you have returned
You did not think to hide your deeds from your ears eyes and skin and you felt that God would not know all that you had been doing
This was how you considered your Lord but He knows you better than you know yourselves Thus you are now lost
Even if they were to exercise patience their dwelling would still be hell fire
Even if they were to seek favors they would receive none
We assigned for them companions who would make their past and present deeds seem attractive to them
Thus they became subject to what the jinn and human beings before were destined to suffer
They were certainly lost
The disbelievers say Do not listen to this Quran but make a lot of unnecessary noise while it is being read so that perhaps you will defeat it
We shall certainly make the unbelievers suffer severe torment and will punish them far worse than what they deserve for their deeds
The recompense of the enemies of God for their rejection of Our revelations will be fire as their eternal dwelling
The disbelievers will say Lord show us the human beings and jinn who caused us to go astray We shall put them under our feet to lower them
To those who have said God is our Lord and who have remained steadfast to their belief the angels will descend saying Do not be afraid or grieved
Receive the glad news of the Paradise which was promised to you
We are your guardians in this world and in the life to come where you will have whatever you call for
a hospitable welcome from the Allforgiving and Allmerciful God
Who speaks better than one who invites human beings to God acts righteously and says I am a Muslim
Virtue and evil are not equal If you replace evil habits by virtuous ones you will certainly find that your enemies will become your intimate friends
Only those who exercise patience and who have been granted a great share of God s favor can find such an opportunity
Muhammad seek God s protection if satan s temptation grieves you for God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Some evidence of His existence are the night day sun and moon
Do not prostrate before the sun and the moon but prostrate before God Who has created them if you want to worship Him alone
However if people are too proud to prostrate before God let them know that God s other creatures glorify Him both day and night without fatigue
Further evidence is that at times you find the earth to be barren
When it is watered it moves and swells to let the plants grow
The One who brings it back to life will also bring the dead back to life
He has power over all things
Those who deviate from Our revelations are not hidden from Us
Is the one who will be thrown into hell fire better than the one who will be brought safely into the presence of God on the Day of Judgment
Act as you wish God is WellAware of whatever you do
The disbelievers do not know that the Quran which was sent to them is certainly a glorious Book
Falsehood can not reach it from any direction
It is the revelation from the Allwise Praiseworthy One
Nothing has been said to you which was not said to the Messengers who lived before you
Your Lord is certainly Allforgiving but stern in His retribution
Had We sent down this Quran in a nonArabic language they would have said Why have its verses not been well expounded
Could a nonArabic Book be revealed to an Arabic speaking person
Muhammad say It is a guide and a cure for the believers
As for those who do not believe they are deaf and blind
It is as though they had been called from a distant place
We had given the Book to Moses about which people greatly disagreed
Had the word of your Lord not been decreed He would have certainly settled their differences there and then
They were greatly suspicious and doubtful about the Book of Moses
Whoever acts righteously does so for his own good and whoever commits evil does so against his soul
Your Lord is not unjust to His servants
It is He who has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom and the fruits that will come out of their covering He knows what the females conceive and deliver
On the day when the unbelievers will be asked Where are the idols which you considered equal to God they will reply We declare that none of us have seen them
Whatever they had worshipped before will disappear and they will then know that there is no way for them to escape
The human being never tires of asking for good but if he is afflicted by hardship he despairs and gives up all hope
When We grant him mercy after his suffering he boldly says This is what I deserved
I do not think that there will ever be a Day of Judgment
Even if I will be returned to my Lord I shall still deserve to receive better rewards from Him
We shall certainly tell the unbelievers about their deeds and cause them to suffer a severe punishment
When We grant the human being a favor he ignores it and turns away but when he is afflicted by hardship he starts lengthy prayers
Say Think if the Quran is from God and you have rejected it then who has gone farther astray than the one who has wandered far from the truth
We shall continue to show them Our evidence in the world and within their souls until it becomes clear that the Quran is the truth
Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord witness all things
They are certainly doubtful about their meeting with their Lord
God indeed encompasses all things
Ha Mim
Sin Qaf
Muhammad this is how God the Majestic and Allwise sends revelations to you and sent them to those who lived before you
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He is the Most High and the Most Great
When the revelation passes through the heavens they almost break apart
At that time the angels glorify their Lord with His praise and seek forgiveness for those who live on earth
God is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God is the guardian of even those who have chosen others idols besides Him as their guardians Muhammad you will not have to answer for them
We have revealed the Quran to you in the Arabic language so that you could warn the people of the Mother Town Mecca and those around it of the inevitable Day of Resurrection when some will go to Paradise and others to hell
Had God wanted He could have made them all one single nation but He grants mercy to whomever He wills
The unjust will have no guardian or helper
Have they chosen other guardians besides Him
God is the real Guardian and it is He who will bring the dead back to life
He has power over all things
Whatever differences you may have about the Quran the final decision rests with God
In Him do I trust and to Him do I turn in repentance
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth He has made you and the cattle in pairs and has multiplied you by His creation
There is certainly nothing like Him
He is Allhearing and Allaware
In His hands are the keys of the heavens and the earth
He increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants
He has the knowledge of all things
He has plainly clarified the religion which is revealed to you and that which Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus were commanded to follow He has explained it so that you would be steadfast and united in your religion
What you call the pagans to is extremely grave for them
God attracts to the religion whomever He wants and guides to it whoever turns to Him in repentance
Only after receiving the knowledge did people divide themselves into different groups because of rebellion among themselves
Had it not been for your Lord s giving them respite for an appointed time He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all
Those who inherited the Book from their quarrelsome predecessors also have doubts and suspicions about it
Thus Muhammad preach My revelation to the people and be steadfast in your faith as you have been commanded
Do not follow their desires but say I believe in the Book which God has sent down and I have been commanded to exercise justice among you
God is our Lord and your Lord
Each of us will be responsible for his own deeds
Let there be no disputes among us
God will bring us all together and to Him we shall all return
The disputes of those who quarrel about God after pledging obedience to Him will be void in the eyes of their Lord
Such people will be subject to His wrath and will suffer a severe torment
It is God who revealed the Book and the Balance for a truthful purpose You never know
Perhaps the Hour of Doom is close at hand
The disbelievers want you to show them the Day of Judgment immediately while the believers are afraid of it for they know it to be the truth
Those who insist on disputing the Hour of Doom are certainly in plain error
God is kind to His servants He gives sustenance to whomever He wants
He is Allpowerful and Majestic
We shall increase the harvest of those who seek a good harvest in the life hereafter However those who want to have their harvest in this life will be given it but will have no share in the hereafter
Do they have idols who have established a religion without the permission of God
Had not it been for your Lord s giving them respite for an appointed time He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all
The unjust will certainly suffer a painful torment
You can see that the unjust are afraid of the consequences of their deeds which will inevitably strike them
However the righteously striving believers will live in the gardens wherein they will have whatever they want from their Lord
This is certainly the greatest reward
This is the glad news which God gives to His servants the righteously striving believers
Muhammad say I do not ask you for any payment for my preaching to you except your love of my near relatives
Whoever achieves virtue will have its merit increased
God is Allforgiving and Appreciating
Do they say that he Muhammad has invented falsehood against God
Had God wanted He could have sealed up your heart
God causes falsehood to vanish and by His words firmly establishes the truth
He has full knowledge of what the hearts contain
It is He who accepts the repentance of His servants forgives their evil deeds and knows all about what you do
He answers the prayers of the righteously striving believers and grants them increasing favors
The unbelievers will suffer a severe punishment
Had God given abundant sustenance to His servants they would have certainly rebelled on earth but He sends them a known measure of sustenance as He wills He is Allaware of His servants and watches over them all
It is He who sends down the rain after they had lost hope and spreads out His mercy
He is the Guardian and the Most Praiseworthy
Some of the evidence of His existence are His creation of the heavens and the earth and the beasts which inhabit it
He has all the power to bring them together if He wishes this to be so
Whatever hardship befalls you is the result of your own deeds
God pardons many of your sins
You cannot challenge God on earth and you will have no one besides Him as your guardian or helper
Further evidence of His existence are the ships which stand as mountains in the sea
Had He wanted He could have stopped the wind and let the ships remain motionless on the surface of the sea in this there is evidence of the Truth for all those who are patient and grateful
or He could have destroyed them as punishment for the human being s deeds However God pardons many sins
He knows all those who dispute His revelations They will find no way to escape from His torment
Whatever you have received is just a means of enjoyment for this life but the reward of God for the believers and those who trust in their Lord will be better and everlasting
This reward will be for those who keep away from major sins and indecency who forgive when they are made angry
who have pledged their obedience to the Lord who are steadfast in prayer who conduct their affairs with consultation among themselves who spend for the cause of God out of what We have given them
and those who when suffering a great injustice seek to defend themselves
The recompense for evil will be equivalent to the deed
He who pardons the evil done to him and reforms himself will receive his reward from God
God certainly does not love the unjust
Those who successfully defend themselves after being wronged will not be questioned
Only those who do injustice to people and commit rebellion on earth for no reason will be questioned
They will suffer a painful torment
To exercise patience and forgive the wrong done to one is the proof of genuine determination
Whomever God has caused to go astray will find no guardian after this
You will see the unjust on facing the torment say Is there any way to turn back
You will see them exposed to the fire subdued in humiliation looking sideways at it pleadingly
However at the same time the believers will say The true losers are those who will lose their souls and families on the Day of Judgment
The unjust will certainly suffer everlasting torment
They will have no guardian or helper besides God
Whoever God has caused to go astray will never find the right direction
Pledge obedience to your Lord before the coming of the inevitable Day when you will find no refuge to escape from God s wrath and no one to defend you
Muhammad if they turn away from your message know that We have not sent you as their keeper
Your duty is only to deliver the message
When We grant mercy to the human being he becomes joyous but when he is afflicted by evil as a result of his own deeds he proves to be ungrateful
To God belongs the heavens and the earth
He created whatever He wanted He grants males female or pairs of
offspring to whomever He wants He causes whomever He wants to be childless
He is AllKnowing and AllPowerful
To no mortal does God speak but through revelation from behind a curtain or by sending a Messenger who reveals by His permission whatever He pleases He is the Most High and the Allwise
Thus We have revealed a Spirit to you Muhammad by Our command
Before you did not even know what a Book or Faith was but We have made the Quran as a light by which We guide whichever of Our servants We want
You certainly guide people to the right path
the path of God who is the owner of all that is in the heavens and the earth
To God certainly do all matters return
Ha Mim
I swear by the illustrious Book
We have made it an Arabic reading text so that perhaps you may understand
It the Quran exists in the original Book with Us which is certainly Most Exalted full of wisdom and beyond linguistic structures
Can We ignore sending you the Quran just because you are a transgressing people
How many Messengers did We send to the ancient people
No Prophet came to them whom they did not mock
We destroyed the strongest among them in power
The stories of the ancient people have already been mentioned
Muhammad if you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth They will certainly say The Majestic and Allknowing God has created them
It is He who has made the earth for you as a cradle and has made roads therein so that you will perhaps seek guidance
It is He who has sent down water from the sky in a known measure by which He has given life to the dead earth
In the same way will you also be resurrected
It is He who has created everything in pairs and the ships and cattle for you to ride
so that perhaps when you ride them you will recall the bounties of your Lord and when you establish your control over it you would say Glory belongs to Him who has made it subservient to us when we would not have been able to do so ourselves
To our Lord we shall all return
The pagans have considered some of His servants as His children
There is no doubt that the human being is simply ungrateful
Has God chosen some of His own creatures as daughters for Himself and has given you the preference of having sons
When one of them is given the glad news of the birth of a daughter which they believe to be the only kind of child that the Beneficent God can have his face blackens with anger
Does God choose for Himself the kind of children who grow up wearing ornaments and who are not strong enough to defend their rights
Do they say that the angels who are the servants of the Beneficent God are females
Have they witnessed their creation
Their words as such will be recorded and they will be questioned for it
The pagans say Had the Beneficent God wanted we would not have worshipped them idols
Whatever they say is not based on knowledge
It is only a false conjecture
Had We before sending the Quran given them a book to which they now refer as an authority
In fact they say We found our fathers following a certain belief and we now follow in their footsteps for our guidance
In the same way whenever We had sent a Messenger before you to warn a town the rich ones therein said We found our fathers following a certain belief and we follow in their footsteps
The Messengers would say Would you still follow in the footsteps of your fathers even if I was to bring you better guidance
They would say We have no faith in your message
We took revenge on them
See how terrible the end of those who rejected Or revelations was
When Abraham said to his father and his people I boldly renounce what you worship
except for the One who has created me and will guide me
God made belief in one God an everlasting task for his successors so that perhaps they would return to Him
In fact We allowed them and their fathers to enjoy themselves until the truth and a strong Messenger came to them
When the truth came to them they said This is magic and we have no faith in it
Then they said Why this Quran had not been revealed to a man from either of the two great towns
Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord
It is We who have distributed their sustenance in this world and raised the positions of some of them above the others so that they would mock each other
The mercy of your Lord is better than what they can amass
Were it not for the fear that all people would become one in disbelief We would have made for the disbelievers in the Beneficent God ceilings out of silver and ladders by which they would climb up
doors for their houses couches on which to recline
and other ornament of gold
All these are only the means of enjoyment in this world but the pious will receive their reward from your Lord in the life hereafter
We shall make satan the companion of whoever ignores the remembrance of the Beneficent God
Satan will prevent them from the right path while they think that they have the right guidance
When he returns to us he will say to satan Would that there had been as long a distance between me and you as that between the East and West
What a terrible companion you have been
They will be told on the Day of Judgment Regret will never be of any benefit to you
You have done injustice to your souls and you will share the torment
Muhammad can you make the deaf hear or guide the blind or the one who is clearly in error
We shall revenge them either after your death
or show them to you suffering the torment with which We had threatened them
We are certainly dominant over them all
Follow devotedly that which is revealed to you
You are certainly on the right path
The Quran is a reminder to you and to your people and you will soon be questioned about it
You can ask Our Messengers whom We sent before you if We had commanded them to worship other gods besides the Beneficent God
We sent Moses to the Pharaoh and his nobles with Our miracles and he said I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Universe
When he showed them Our miracles they started to laugh at them
Of all the miracles which We showed to them the latter ones were greater than the former We struck them with torment so that perhaps they would return to Us
They said Magician pray to your Lord for us through your covenant with Him If he saves us from the torment we shall certainly seek guidance
When We relieved them from the torment they suddenly turned back on their heels
The Pharaoh shouted to his people My people is the kingdom of Egypt not mine and can you not see that the streams flow from beneath my palace
Am I not better than this lowly man who can barely express himself
Why have bracelets of gold not been given to him and why have some angels not accompanied him
Thus he made dimwits out of his people and they followed him They certainly were a sinful people
When they invoked Our anger
We took revenge on them by drowning them all together
We made them become of the people of the past and an example for the coming generations
When the son of Mary was mentioned as an example you people cried out in protest saying
Are our gods any better than Jesus for according to Muhammad if our gods go to hell so too will Jesus What they say is only a false argument
In fact they are a quarrelsome people
Jesus was a servant of Ours to whom We had granted favors and whom We made as an example for the Israelites
Had We wanted We could have made the angels as your successors on the earth
Muhammad tell them Jesus is a sign of the Hour of Doom
Have no doubt about it and follow me this is the straight path
Let satan not prevent you from the right path
He is your sworn enemy
When Jesus came with clear proof in support of his truthfulness he said I have come to you with wisdom to clarify for you some of the matters in which you have disputes
Have fear of God and obey me
God is your Lord and my Lord so worship Him
This is the right path
But certain groups created differences among themselves Woe to the unjust
They will face a painful torment
Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom when the torment will suddenly strike them and they will not even realize from where it came
All intimate friends on that day will become each others enemies except for the pious
whom God will tell My servants you need have no fear on this day nor will you be grieved
Those who have faith in Our revelations and have submitted themselves to Our will
will be told Enter Paradise with your spouses in delight
Golden dishes and cups will be passed among them
All that the souls may desire and that may delight their eyes will be available therein
You will live therein forever
This is the Paradise which you have received as your inheritance by virtue of what you have done
You will have abundant fruits therein to consume
The criminals will live forever in the torment of hell Their torment will not be relieved and they will despair of escaping
We had not done any injustice to them but they had wronged themselves
They will cry out Guard let your Lord destroy us
The angelic guard will say You will have to stay
We brought you the truth but most of you disliked it
If the disbelievers persist in their disbelief We shall also persist in punishing them
Do they think that We do not hear their secrets and whispers
We certainly can hear them and Our Messengers record it all
Muhammad say Had the Beneficent God really had a son I would certainly have been the first one to worship him
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and the Throne is too glorious to be described in the way they describe Him
Leave them to indulge in their desires and play around until they face that day which has been promised to them
It is God who is the Lord of the heavens and is the Lord on earth
He is Allwise and Allknowing
Blessed is He to whom belongs the heavens the earth and all that is between them and who has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom
To Him you will all return
Those whom they worship besides God are not able to intercede except for those among them who believe in the Truth God and who know whom to intercede for
Muhammad if you ask them Who had created the idols They will certainly say God has created them
Why do you then turn away from God
God has knowledge of Muhammad s words when he complains to Him My Lord these my people do not believe
We have told him Ignore them and say to them farewell
They will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Ha Mim
I swear by the illustrious Book
that We have revealed the Quran on a blessed night to warn mankind
On this night every absolute command coming from Us becomes distinguishable
The command that We have been sending
as a mercy for the human being from your Lord
Your Lord is Allhearing and Allknowing
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if only you would have strong faith
There is only One Lord
It is He who gives life and causes things to die
He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
In fact the unbelievers have doubts because of excessive involvement in worldly affairs
Wait for the day which will come before the Day of Judgment when the sky will give out dense smoke
which will smother the people
They will say This is a painful torment
Lord remove this torment from us for we are believers
How could this punishment bring them to their senses when a Messenger evidently had come to them
and they turned away saying He is a trained and insane person
We shall remove the torment for a while but you will revert to your old ways
However We shall truly take Our revenge on the day when the great seizure takes place
We had certainly tested the people of the Pharaoh before them to whom a noble Messengers had come saying
Send the servants of God with me
I am a trustworthy Messenger sent to you
Do not consider yourselves above God
I shall show you a manifest authority in support of my truthfulness
I seek protection from my Lord and your Lord from your decision of stoning me
If you do not want to believe leave me alone
Moses addressed his Lord saying Lord these people are sinners
We told him Leave the city with My servants during the night
You will be pursued
Cross the sea by cutting a path through it
Pharaoh s army will be drowned
How many were the gardens springs
cornfields gracious mansions
and other bounties which they enjoyed yet left behind
We gave these as an inheritance to other people
The sky nor the earth cried for them nor were they given respite
We rescued the Israelites from the humiliating torment
and from the Pharaoh
He was the chief of the transgressors
We gave preference to the Israelites over the other people with Our knowledge
and sent them revelations of which some were a clear trial for them
These people say
After we die we shall never be raised to life again
Bring back to life our fathers if what you say is true
Are they better than the tribe of Tubba name of a Yemenite tribal chief and those who lived before them
We destroyed them
They were criminals
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for Our own amusement
We have created them for a genuine purpose but most people do not know
The appointed time for all of them will be the Day of Judgment
when wrong will be distinguished from right
On this day friends will be of no benefit to one another nor will they receive any help
except for those to whom God grants mercy
He is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tree of Zaqqum
is food for the sinner
It will be like molted brass which will boil in the bellies
like water
It will be said of such sinners Seize them and drag them into the middle of hell
Then pour unto their heads the boiling water to torment them
They will be told Suffer the torment
You had thought yourselves to be majestic and honorable
This is the torment that you persistently doubted
The pious ones will be in a secure place
amid gardens and springs
clothed in fine silk and rich brocade sitting face to face with one another
We shall unite them to maidens with big black and white lovely eyes
They will be offered all kinds of fruits in peace and security
They will not experience any death other than that which they have already been through
God will protect them from the torment of hell as a favor from your Lord
Muhammad this is certainly the greatest triumph
We have made the Quran easy for you to recite so that perhaps they may take heed
Wait for God s decree and they too will be waiting
Ha Mim
This Book is revealed from God the Majestic and Allwise
In the heavens and the earth there is evidence of the Truth for the believers
In your creation and in that of the beasts living on earth there is evidence of the Truth for the people who have strong faith
In the alternation of the night and the day the sustenance which God has sent down from the sky to revive the barren earth and in the changing of the direction of the winds there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
These are the revelations of God which We recite to you for a genuine purpose
In what statements other than God s and His revelations will they then believe
Woe to every sinful liar
He hears the revelations of God which are recited to him then persists in his arrogance as if he had not even heard them
Tell him that he will suffer a painful torment
When he learns about some of Our revelations he mocks them
Such people will suffer a humiliating torment
Hell is awaiting them and none of their deeds will be of any benefit to them nor will any guardian whom they have chosen besides God
They will suffer a great torment
This Quran is a guidance
Those who reject the revelations of their Lord will suffer the most painful punishment
God has made the sea subservient to you so that ships sail on by His command and you seek His favors
Perhaps you will be grateful
He has also made subservient to you all that is in the heavens and the earth
In this there is evidence of the Truth for those who use their minds
Tell the believers to forgive those who do not have faith in the days of God Day of Judgment and Resurrection
God will give due recompense to all the people for their deeds
One who acts righteously does so for his own benefit and one who commits evil does so against his own soul
To your Lord you will all return
We gave the Book to the Israelites the commandments and prophethood granted them pure sustenance and gave them preference above all people
We also gave them clear evidence in support of the true religion
Only after having received knowledge did they create differences among themselves because of their rebelliousness
Your Lord will issue His decree concerning their differences on the Day of Judgment
We have established for you a code of conduct and a religion
Follow it and do not follow the desires of the ignorant people
They will never be sufficient protection for you in place of God
The unjust are each other s friends but God is the guardian of the pious ones
This Quran is an enlightenment for the people and a guide and mercy for the people who have strong faith
Do the people who commit evil think that We shall make their life and death like that of the righteously striving believers How terrible is their Judgment
God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose so that every soul will be duly recompensed for its deeds without being wronged
Have you seen the one who has chosen his desires as his lord
God has knowingly caused him to go astray sealed his ears and heart and veiled his vision
Who besides God can guide him
Will they then not take heed
They have said The only life is this worldly life and here we shall live and die
It is only time which will destroy us They have no knowledge about this
It is only their guesswork
When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them their only argument against it is Bring our forefathers back to life if what you say is true
Muhammad say It is God who gives you life and causes you to die
He will bring you together on the inevitable Day of Judgment but most people do not know
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
On the day when the Hour of Doom arrives the followers of falsehood will be lost
You will see all the people kneeling down
Everyone will be summoned to the Book containing the record of their deeds
They will be told On this day you will be recompensed for what you have done
This is Our Book
It will tell you the truth
We have made a copy of all that you have done
The Lord will admit the righteously striving believing people into His mercy
This is certainly a clear victory
To the unbelievers the Lord will say Were not Our revelations recited to you and did not you arrogantly reject them You were a sinful people
When it was said that the promise of God is true and that the Hour would inevitably come you said We do not know what the Hour of Doom is we are suspicious about it and we are not convinced
Their evil deeds will be revealed to them and the torment which they had mocked will surround them
They will be told On this day We shall forget you in the same way that you had forgotten your coming into Our presence
Your dwelling will be hell fire and no one will help you
This is only because you had mocked the revelations of God and the worldly life had deceived you
On this day they will not be taken out of hell nor will they be granted any favors
It is only God Lord of the heavens and the earth and Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
It is His greatness that dominates the heavens and the earth
He is the Majestic and Allwise
Ha Mim
This Book is revealed from God the Majestic and Allwise
We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ONLY for a genuine purpose and an appointed time
The unbelievers ignore that of which they have been warned
Muhammad ask them Have you thought about what you worship besides God Show me which part of the earth they have created
Do they have a share in the creation of the heavens
Bring me a Book revealed before this Quran or any other proof based on knowledge to support your belief if indeed you are truthful
Who is more astray than one who prays to things besides God things that would not be able to answer his prayers even if he would wait till the Day of Judgment They are not even aware of his prayers
When people will be resurrected such gods will become their enemies and will reject their worship
When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them the disbelievers of the truth which has come to them say This is plain magic
They say Muhammad has invented it Quran by himself
Say Had I invented it you would not have been able to rescue me from God
He knows best what you say about it
He is our witness and He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Say I am not the first Messenger
I do not know what will be done to me or to you
I follow only what has been revealed to me and my duty is only to give clear warning
Say What do you think will happen if this Quran is from God and you have rejected it Besides a witness from among the Israelites has testified to the divinity of a Book like it and believed in it Quran while you have arrogantly denied it
God does not guide the unjust
The disbelievers have said about the believers Had there been anything good in it Quran they could not have accepted it before us Since they do not benefit from its guidance they say It Quran is only a fabricated legend
Before this Quran the Book of Moses was a guide and a blessing
This Book confirms the Torah It is in the Arabic language so that it may warn the unjust people and give glad news to the righteous ones
Those who have said Our Lord is God and are steadfast in their belief need have no fear or be grieved
They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever as a reward for what they have done
We have advised the human being to be kind to his parents his mother bore him with hardship and delivered him while suffering a great deal of pain
The period in which his mother bore and weaned him lasted for thirty months
When he grewup to manhood and became forty years old he then said Lord inspire me to give You thanks for the bounties you have granted to me and my parents and to act righteously to please You
Lord make my offspring virtuous
Lord I turn to you in repentance I am a Muslim
These are the ones from whom We accept righteous deeds and ignore their bad deeds They will be among the dwellers of Paradise
There are people who say to their parents Fie upon you
Are you telling us that we shall be raised from our graves So many people have died before us and none of them have been raised Their parents plead to God and say to their child Woe to you
Have faith the promise of God is certainly true They reply What you say is only ancient legends
Such people will be subject to the punishment of God which was also decreed for many human beings and jinn before them
These people are certainly lost
Everyone will have a position proportionate to the degree of his deeds Finally God will recompense them for their deeds and they will not be wronged
On the day when the disbelievers will be exposed to the fire they will be told You have spent your happy days during your worldly life and enjoyed them On this day you will suffer a humiliating torment for your unreasonably arrogant manners on earth and for the evil deeds which you have committed
Muhammad recall the brother of the people of Ad when he warned his people in the valley of alahqaf saying There existed many warners before and after him Do not worship anything other than God
I am afraid for you about the torment of the great Day
They said Have you come to turn us away from our gods
Show us that with which you threaten us if you are truthful
He said Only God has the knowledge of the coming of such torment
I preach to you the message that I have brought but I can see that you are an ignorant people
When they saw the torment as a cloud proceeding to their valleys they said This cloud will bring us rain
He said No it is the torment which you wanted to suffer immediately It is a wind bearing and painful torment
It will destroy everything by the will of its Lord Not very long after nothing could be seen of them except their dwellings
Thus do We recompense the sinful people
We had established them more firmly in the land than you are We had given them ears eyes and hearts but none of their ears eyes and hearts proved to be of any benefit to them they rejected the revelations of God and the torment which they mocked brought upon them utter destruction
We destroyed some towns around you and showed you the evidence of the Truth so that perhaps you would turn to God
Why did the idols whom they worshipped as a means of pleasing God not help them
In fact they proved to be the cause of their going astray and it were lies which they had falsely invented lies
We turned a party of jinn towards you to listen to the Quran
When they attended a Quranic recitation they said to each other Be silent and when it was over they turned back to their people in warning
and said Our people we have listened to the recitation of a Book revealed after Moses It confirms the Books revealed before and guides to the Truth and the right path
Our people respond favorably to the Messenger of God and believe in Him
He will forgive your sins and rescue you from the painful torment
Those who do not favorably respond to the Messenger of God should know that they cannot challenge God on earth and will not have anyone as their guardian besides Him
Such people are in plain error
Have they not seen that God has created the heavens and the earth and that He experienced no fatigue in doing this He has the power to bring the dead back to life
Certainly He has power over all things
On the day when the disbelievers will be exposed to the fire they will be asked Is this not real
They will say Yes Our Lord it is real He will say Suffer the torment for your disbelief
Muhammad exercise patience as did the steadfast Messengers
Do not try to make them suffer the torment immediately on the day when they will see the torment with which they were threatened they will think that they had lived no more than an hour
The message has been delivered
No one else will be destroyed except the evil doing people
God has made devoid of all virtue the deeds of those who have disbelieved and prevented others from the way of God
God forgives the sins and reforms the hearts of the righteously striving believers who have faith in what is revealed to Muhammad which is the Truth from his Lord
This is because the disbelievers have followed falsehood and the believers have followed the Truth from their Lord
Thus God explains to the human being their own prospects
If you encounter the disbelievers in a battle strikeoff their heads
Take them as captives when they are defeated
Then you may set them free as a favor to them with or without a ransom when the battle is over
This is the Law
Had God wanted He could have granted them unbelievers victory but He wants to test you through each other
The deeds of those who are killed for the cause of God will never be without virtuous results
God will lead them to everlasting happiness and improve their condition
He will admit them into the Paradise which He has made known to them
Believers if you help God He will help you and make you steadfast in your faith
The fate of the disbelievers will be to stumble and their deeds will have no virtuous results
they have hated God s revelation and thus He has made their deeds devoid of all virtue
Have they not travelled through the land and seen the terrible end of those who lived before them
God brought upon them utter destruction and the disbelievers will also faced similar perdition
God is the guardian of the believers but the disbelievers have no guardian
God will admit the righteously striving believers into the gardens wherein streams flow
However the disbelievers who enjoyed themselves and ate like cattle will have for their dwelling hell fire
Muhammad how many towns much more powerful than the one from which you have been expelled have We destroyed and left helpless
Can the one who follows the authority of his Lord be considered equal to the one whose evil deeds are made to seem attractive to him and who follows his own desires
The garden which is promised to the pious is like one in which there are streams of unpolluted water streams of milk of unchangeable taste streams of delicious wine and streams of crystal clear honey
Therein they will have all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord
On the other hand can these people be considered like those who will live forever in hell fire and will drink boiling water which will rip their intestines to bits
Muhammad some of them listen to you but when they leave you they ask those who have received knowledge What did he say a few moments ago
God has sealed the hearts of such people who have followed their worldly desires
God will increase the guidance and piety of those who seek guidance
Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom to suddenly approach them
Its signs have already appeared
How will they then come to their senses when the Hour itself will approach them
Know that God is the only Lord
Ask forgiveness for your sins and for the sins of the believing men and women
God knows when you move and when you rest
The believers say Why is a chapter about jihad fighting for the cause of God not revealed
But when such a chapter with clear commands and a mention of jihad is revealed you will see those whose hearts are sick look at you as if suffering the agony of death
One can expect nothing better from them
Since they have pledged Us obedience and to speak reasonably it would be more proper for them when it is decided that everyone must take part in the battle to remain true in their pledge to God
If you ignore the commands of God would you then also spread evil in the land and sever the ties of kinship
God has condemned these people and made them deaf dumb and blind
Is it that they do not think about the Quran or are their hearts sealed
Those who have reverted to disbelief after guidance has become manifest to them have been seduced and given false hopes by satan
This is because they have said to those who hate God s revelation We shall obey you in some matters
But God knows all their secrets
How terrible it will be for them when the angels take away their souls by striking their faces and their backs
for their following that which had incurred God s anger and their hatred to please God
Thus God has made their deeds devoid of all virtue
Do those whose hearts are sick think that God will never make their malice public
Had We wanted We could have made you recognize their faces
You will certainly recognize them by the tone of their speech
God knows all your deeds
We shall certainly test you until We know those who strive hard for the cause of God and those who exercise patience
We will also examine your deeds
The disbelievers who prevent others from the way of God and give the Messengers a hard time even after the guidance has been made clear to them will never be able to cause any harm to God and He will turn their deeds devoid of all virtue
Believers obey God and the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds
God will never forgive the disbelievers who prevent others from the way of God and who die as disbelievers
Do not be weak hearted and do not appeal for an unjust settlement you have the upper hand
God is with you and He will never reduce the reward for your deeds
The worldly life is only a childish game
If you have faith and piety you will receive your rewards and God will not ask you to pay for them
Should He ask for your possessions you would be niggardly as it would be hard for you to give Thus He would make your malice become public
It is you who are asked to spend for the cause of God but some of you behave in a niggardly way
Whoever behaves miserly does so against his own soul
God is Selfsufficient and you are poor
If you were to turn away from Him He would just replace you with another people who will not be like you
We have granted to you Muhammad a manifest victory
so that God will redeem the sins which the pagans think you have committed against them in the past or you will commit in the future He will complete His favors to you guide you to the right path
and grant you a majestic triumph
It is God who has given confidence to the hearts of the believers to increase and strengthen their faith
To God belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth
He is Allknowing and Allwise
So that He would admit the believers both male and female to the gardens wherein streams flow to live therein forever He will redeem them
This is the greatest triumph in the sight of God
so that He would punish the hypocrites and the pagans who have evil suspicions about God
It is they who are surrounded by evil and have become subject to the wrath and condemnation of God
He has prepared for them hell a terrible place to live
To God belong the armies of the heavens and the earth
God is Majestic and Allwise
We have sent you as a witness a bearer of glad news and a warner
so that you people may believe in God and His Messenger help and respect God and glorify Him in the morning and the evening
Those who pledge obedience to you are in fact pledging obedience to God
The hands of God are above their hands
As for those who disregard their pledge they do so only against their own souls
Those who fulfill their promise to God will receive a great reward
The bedouins who lag behind in taking part in the battle say to you Ask forgiveness for us we were busy with our property and household
They speak what is not in their hearts
Muhammad tell them Who will help you against God if He intends to harm you who will prevent Him from benefitting you
In fact God is Well Aware of whatever you do
You thought the Messenger and the believers would never ever return to their families and this attracted your hearts and caused you to develop evil suspicions
You are a wrong doing people
Those who do not believe in God and His Messenger should know that We have prepared hell for the disbelievers
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He forgives or punishes whomever He wants
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The laggardly Bedouins will say When you leave to collect the spoils let us follow you
They want to alter the command of God that only the participating believers are entitled to such benefit
Tell them You can never follow us for such a purpose
God has said before and He will say again what type of people you are In fact you are jealous of us
The truth is that they understand very little
Tell the laggardly Bedouins You will be called to face strong people whom you will fight right to the end or who will submit to you
If you obey the Messenger God will give you a good reward
But if you turn away as you did before God will make you suffer a painful torment
It is not an offense for the blind the lame or the sick not to take part in the battle
Whoever obeys God and His Messenger will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow
God will make whoever turns away suffer a painful torment
God is pleased with the believers for their pledging obedience to you under the tree
He knew whatever was in their hearts thus He granted them confidence and rewarded them with an immediate victory
and the booty which they received from it the Battle
God is Majestic and Allwise
God has promised that you will receive much booty
He has enabled you to receive this at this time and has protected you from enemies to make it an evidence of the Truth for the believers He will guide you to the right path
Besides these there were other gains which you could not receive but God has full control over them
God has power over all things
Had the disbelievers fought against you they would have run away from the battle and would have found no guardian or helper
This is the tradition of God which existed before and you will never find any change in His tradition
It is He who kept peace between you and the people of the valley of Mecca after having given you a victory over them
God is Well Aware of what you do
It was the disbelievers who kept you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your sacrificial offering from reaching its proper place
God would not have kept you from fighting the disbelievers had there not been believing men and women among them whom you did not know and whom you might have unknowingly harmed
God did this because He grants mercy to whomever He wants
Had they been distinguishable from the believers We would certainly have punished them with a painful torment
Since the disbelievers held zealous ignorance in their hearts like that of the preIslamic age of darkness God gave confidence to His Messenger and to the believers binding them to the principle of piety which they deserve
God has the knowledge of all things
God made the dream of His Messenger come true for a genuine purpose
In this he was told If God wills You believers will enter the Sacred Mosque in security with your heads shaved nails cut and without any fear in your hearts
He knew what you did not know
Besides this victory He will give you another immediate victory
It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the true religion to make it prevail over all other religions
God is a Sufficient witness to this Truth
Muhammad is the Messenger of God and those with him are stern to the disbelievers yet kind among themselves
You can see them bowing and prostrating before God seeking His favors and pleasure
Their faces foreheads are marked due to the effect of their frequent prostrations
That is their description in the Torah and in the Gospel they are mentioned as the seed which shoots out its stalk then becomes stronger harder and stands firm on its stumps attracting the farmers
Thus God has described the believers to enrage the disbelievers
God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to the righteously striving believers
Believers do not be presumptuous with the Messenger of God in your deeds and in your words
Have fear of God He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Believers do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet do not be too loud in speaking to him as you may have been to one another lest your deeds will be made devoid of all virtue without your realizing it
The hearts of those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of God are tested by God through piety
They will have forgiveness and a great reward
Most of those who call you from behind the private chambers do not have any understanding
Had they exercised patience until you had come out it would have been better for them
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers if one who publicly commits sins brings you any news ascertain its truthfulness carefully lest you harm people through ignorance and then regret what you have done
Know that the Messenger of God is with you
Had he yielded to you on many of the matters you would have been in great trouble
But God has endeared the faith to you and has made it attractive to your hearts He has made disbelief evil deeds and disobedience hateful to you
Such people will have the right guidance
as a favor and a blessing from God
God is Allknowing and Allwise
If two parties among the believers start to fight against each other restore peace among them
If one party rebels against the other fight against the rebellious one until he surrenders to the command of God
When he does so restore peace among them with justice and equality God loves those who maintain justice
Believers are each other s brothers
Restore peace among your brothers Have fear of God so that perhaps you will receive mercy
Believers let not a group of you mock another
Perhaps they are better than you
Let not women mock each other perhaps one is better than the other
Let not one of you find faults in another nor let anyone of you defame another
How terrible is the defamation after having true faith
Those who do not repent are certainly unjust
Believers stay away from conjecture acting upon some conjecture may lead to sin
Do not spy on one another or backbite
Would any of you like to eat the disgusting dead flesh of your brother
Have fear of God God accepts repentance and is Allmerciful
People We have created you all male and female and have made you nations and tribes so that you would recognize each other
The most honorable among you in the sight of God is the most pious of you
God is Allknowing and Allaware
The bedouin Arabs have said We are believers
Tell them You are not believers but you should say that you are Muslims
In fact belief has not yet entered your hearts
If you obey God and His Messenger nothing will be reduced from your deeds
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger who do not change their belief into doubt and who strive hard for the cause of God with their property and persons
They are the truthful ones
Muhammad say Do you teach God about your religion
God knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth
He has the knowledge of all things
The bedouins tell you that you owe them a great deal for their embracing Islam
Tell them You are not doing me any favors by embracing Islam
In fact it is God who has done you a great favor by guiding you to the faith Think about this if you are people of truth
God knows whatever is unseen in the heavens and in the earth
He is Well Aware of what you do
By Qaf and the glorious Quran you are the Messenger of God
In fact it seems odd to the pagans that a warner from their own people has come to them The disbelievers have said It is very strange
that after we die and become dust we shall be brought back to life again
This seems far from reality
We already know how much of them of their bodies the earth will consume
With Us there is a Book that contains all records
In fact they have rejected the truth that has come to them thus they live in confusion
Have they not seen how We have established the sky above them and decked it without gaps and cracks
Have they not seen how We have spread out the earth placed on it firm mountains and have made all kinds of flourishing pairs of plants grow
This is a reminder and it sharpens the insight of every servant of God who turns to Him in repentance
We have sent blessed water down from the sky to grow gardens harvestable crops
and tall palmtrees with clusters of dates
as sustenance for My servants
With this We have brought the dead land back to life
Thus will also be your resurrection
The people of Noah dwellers of the Ra s Thamud
Ad the Pharaoh Lot
dwellers of the forest and the people of Tubba had all rejected the Prophets Thus they became subject to Our torment
Did We fail to accomplish the first creation
Of course We did not We have all power over all things
Yet they are confused about a new creation
We swear that We have created the human being and We know what his soul whispers to him
We are closer to him than even his jugular vein
Since the two scribes are sitting on each of his shoulders he does not utter a word which is not recorded immediately by the watchful scribes
The human being will certainly experience the agony of death
and the human being will be told This is what you had been trying to run away from
The trumpet will certainly be sounded
This will be the day about which you were threatened
Every soul will be accompanied by an angel behind him and another as a witness
He will be told You were completely heedless of this day
We have removed the veil from your eyes and your vision will now be sharp and strong
His angelic companion will say Lord the record of his deeds is with me and is all ready
They will be told Throw into hell every persistent disbelievers
who is an opponent of good a suspicious transgressor
and an idol worshipper
Throw him into severe torment
His satanic companion will say Our Lord I did not mislead him but he himself went astray
The Lord will say Do not argue in My presence I had certainly sent you a warning
No word is to be exchanged in My presence
I am not unjust to My servants
On that day We shall ask hell Are you full It will say Are there any more
Paradise will be brought near for the pious ones
and they will be told This is what you were promised
It is for everyone who turned in repentance to God kept his promise
feared the Beneficent God in secret and turned to Him with a repenting heart
They will be told Enter Paradise in peace and therein you will live forever
They will have therein whatever they want and will receive from Us more rewards
How many an ancient town who were much stronger than them unbelievers did We destroy
In vain they wandered through the land in search of a place of refuge from Our torment
This is a reminder for everyone who understands listens and sees
We created the heavens the earth and all that is between them in six days without experiencing any fatigue
Muhammad exercise patience against what they say
Glorify your Lord with His praise before sunrise and sunset
Glorify Him during the night and also glorify Him after prostration
Wait for the day when the trumpet will be sounded from a nearby place
On that day they will certainly hear the sound of the trumpet and that will be the Day of Resurrection
We give life and cause things to die
To Us all things will return
On the day when the earth is rent asunder they will quickly come out of their graves
This is how easy it is for Us to bring about the Day of Resurrection
We know best what they say and you cannot compel them
Remind by way of the Quran those who have fear of My warnings
By the winds which carry dust particles
by the clouds which are heavily loaded with water
by the ships which smoothly sail on the oceans
by the angels which distribute the affairs
that what you are promised is certainly true
and the Day of Judgment will inevitably take place
By the beautiful heavens
your ideas are confused
Let whoever wishes turn away from Our Quran
Death to those whose opinions are merely baseless conjectures
and who wander in the abyss of confusion
They ask When it will be the Day of Judgment
On the Day of Judgment they will be punished by the fire
and will be told Suffer the torment which you wanted to experience immediately
The pious ones will live amidst gardens and springs
receiving their reward from their Lord
They had been righteous people before the Day of Judgment
They slept very little during the night
and asked for forgiveness in the early morning
They assigned a share of their property for the needy and the destitute
In the earth there is evidence of the Truth for those who have strong faith
There is also evidence of the Truth within your own selves
Will you then not see
In the heavens there is your sustenance and that which you were promised Paradise
This by the Lord of the heavens and the earth is as certain as your ability to speak
Have you heard the story of the honorable guests of Abraham
When they came to him saying Peace be with you he replied to their greeting in the same manner and said to himself These are a strange people
He went quietly to his wife and returned to his guests with a fat roasted calf
He placed it before them Then he said Why are you not eating
He began to feel afraid
They said Do not be afraid and then gave him the glad news of the birth of a knowledgeable son
His wife came forward crying and beating her face saying I am an old barren woman
They said This is true but your Lord has said that you will have a son He is Allwise and Allknowing
Abraham asked Messengers what is your task
They replied We have been sent to a sinful people
to bring down upon them showers of marked lumps of clayy
They are transgressors in the presence of your Lord
We saved the believers among them
but We found only one Muslim house
We left therein evidence for those who fear the painful torment
There is also evidence of the Truth in the story of Moses when We sent him to the Pharaoh with clear authority
The Pharaoh and his forces turned away from him saying He is either a magician or an insane person
We seized him and his army and threw them into the sea
He himself was to be blamed
There is also evidence of the Truth in the story of Ad whom We struck with a violent wind
which turned everything it approached into dust
There is also evidence of the Truth in the story of the Thamud who were told to enjoy themselves for an appointed time
They transgressed against the command of their Lord So a blast of sound struck them and they were unable to do anything but stare
They were unable to stand up nor were they helped
The people of Noah who lived before them were also evil doing people
We have made the heavens with Our own hands and We expanded it
We have spread out the earth and how brilliantly it is spread
We have created everything in pairs so that perhaps you may take heed
Muhammad tell them Seek refuge in God
I have been sent from Him to plainly warn you
Do not choose other gods besides Him
I have been sent from Him to plainly warn you
In the same way no Messenger came to those who lived before them without his people calling him a magician or an insane person
Have they inherited such dealings with the Prophets from their predecessors or are they a rebellious people
Muhammad leave them alone and you will not be blamed
Keep on reminding them
This benefits the believers
We have created jinn and human beings only that they might worship Me
I do not expect to receive any sustenance from them or that they should feed Me
It is God Who is the Sustainer and the Lord of invincible strength
The unjust will bear a burden like that of their unjust predecessors
Let them not make Me bring immediate punishment upon them
Woe to the disbelievers when the day with which they have been threatened comes
By the Mount Sinai
by the book Torah written
on parchment for distribution
by the established House Mecca
by the high ceiling heaven
and by the swelling ocean
the torment of your Lord will inevitably take place
and no one will be able to prevent it
On the day when the heavens will swiftly fly
and the mountains quickly move
Woe will be to those who rejected the Truth
and who indulged in false disputes against God s revelations
On that day they will be violently pushed into the fire
and they will be told This is the fire which you called a lie
Is it magic or do you not still see
Burn in its heat
It is all the same for you whether you exercise patience or not This is the recompense for your deeds
The pious will live in bountiful Paradise
talking of what they have received from their Lord and of how their Lord has saved them from the torment of hell
They will be told Eat and drink to your heart s delight for what you have done
They will recline on couches arranged in rows and We shall couple them with maidens with large lovely eyes
The offspring of the believers will also follow them to Paradise So shall We join their offspring to them because of their faith
We shall reduce nothing from their deeds
Everyone will be responsible for his own actions
We shall provide them with fruits and the meat of the kind which they desire
They will pass cups of unintoxicating and unsinful wine to one another
They will be served by youths who will be as beautiful as pearls
They will turn to one another ask questions
saying We were afraid while in the world
But God has granted us favors and saved us from the scorching heat of the torment
We had prayed to Him He is Kind and Allmerciful
Muhammad remind them by the Grace of your Lord that you are neither a soothsayer or an insane person
Do they say He is only a poet and we are waiting to see him die
Say Wait I too am waiting with you
Does their reason tell them to say this or is it because they are a rebellious people
Do they say He has falsely invented it the Quran
In fact they themselves have no faith
Let them produce a discourse like it if they are true in their claim
Have they been created from nothing or are they themselves their own creators
Have they created the heavens and the earth
In fact they have no strong faith
Do they own the treasures of your Lord
Have they any authority over God
Do they have a ladder by which they can climb up to the heavens and listen to the angels and come back to the rest of the people with clear authority
Do the daughters belong to Him and the sons to you
Do you Muhammad ask them for any payment for your preaching which they cannot afford
Do they have knowledge of the unseen thus are able to predict the future
Do they design evil plans
The disbelievers themselves will be snared by their evil plots
Do they have another god besides God
God is too exalted to be considered equal to the idols
Even if they were to see a part of the heavens falling down upon them they would say It is only dense cloud
So leave them alone until they face the day when they will be struck dead from terror
and when their evil plans will be of no benefit to them nor will they be helped
The unjust will suffer other torments besides this but most of them do not know
Wait patiently for the command of your Lord
We are watching over you
Glorify your Lord when you rise during the night
and glorify Him after the setting of the stars
By the declining star
your companion is not in error nor has he gone astray
He does not speak out of his own desires
It is a revelations which has been revealed to him
and taught to him
by the great mighty one Gabriel
the strong one who appeared on the uppermost horizon
He Gabriel then came nearer and nearer
until he was as close to him as the distance of two bows or even less
He revealed to God s servant whatever he wanted
His Muhammad s heart did not lie to him about what his eyes had seen
Will you then argue with him about what he saw
He certainly saw him Gabriel during his other ascent
to the Lottree in the seven heavens
near which is Paradise
When the tree was covered with a covering
Muhammad s eyes did not deceive him nor did they lead him to falsehood
He certainly saw the greatest signs of the existence of his Lord
Can anything as such be considered true of alLat alUzza
and your third idol alManat whom you considered as God s daughters
Do sons belong to you and daughters to God
This is an unfair distinction
These are only names given by yourselves and your fathers
God has not given them any authority
They unbelievers only follow mere conjecture and the desires of their souls even though guidance has already come to them from their Lord
Can the human being have whatever he wishes
All that is in the life to come and all that is in this life belongs only to God
There are many angels in the heavens whose intercession will be of no benefit unless God grants such permission to whichever of them He wants
Only those who do not believe in the life hereafter call the angels females They have no knowledge about it
They only follow mere conjecture which can never sufficiently replace the Truth
Muhammad stay away from those who turn away from Our guidance and who do not desire anything except the worldly life
This is what the extent of their knowledge amounts to
Your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path and who has been rightly guided
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
In the end God will recompense the evil doers for their deeds and reward the righteous ones for their deeds
Those who stay away from grave sins and indecency should know that for their trivial sins your Lord s forgiveness is vast
He knows best about you
When He created you from the earth and when you were embryos in your mother s wombs
Do not consider yourselves very great
God knows best who is the most righteous person
Muhammad have you ever seen the one who has turned away from guidance
and grudgingly spends very little for the cause of God
Does he possess the knowledge of the unseen thus he sees all things
Has not he been informed of the contents of the Book of Moses
and about Abraham who fulfilled his duty to God
Certainly no one will bear the responsibility of the sins of another
nor can man achieve anything without hard labor
He will certainly see the result of his labor
and will be fully recompensed for his deeds
To your Lord will all things eventually return
It is He who causes laughter and weeping
It is He who causes death and gives life
It is He who has created spouses male and female
from a discharged living germ
and on Him depends the life hereafter
It is He who grants people temporary and durable wealth
It is He who is the Lord of Sirius
It is He who utterly destroyed the ancient tribes of Ad
Thamud
and the people of Noah they were the most unjust and rebellious people
It is He who turned upside down the people of Lot
and covered them with torment
About which of the bounties of your Lord can they persistently dispute
This is a Prophet like that of the ancient warners Prophets
The Day of Judgment is drawing nearer
No one besides God can rescue a soul from hardship
Does this statement seem strange to them
and do they laugh instead of weeping
indulging in carelessly idle games
So prostrate yourselves before God and worship him
The Hour of Doom is drawing near and the moon is rent asunder
Whenever they see a miracle they turn away from it and say This is just a powerful magic
They have rejected it and have followed their own desires but all matters will be settled by God
They have certainly received the kind of news in which there is a lesson and strong words of wisdom
but the warnings have proved to have no effect on them
Muhammad leave them alone
On the day when they will be called to a terrible punishment
they will come out of their graves their eyes cast down hastening towards their Summoner as locusts rushing about
These disbelievers will say This is a hard day
The people of Noah who lived before them had also rejected Our guidance They rejected Our servant and said He is an insane person so let us drive him away
Noah prayed Lord help me I am defeated
We opened the gates of the sky and water started to pour down
We caused the earth to burst forth with springs so that the waters could come together for a predestined purpose
We carried him Noah on a vessel built with boards fixed together with nails
which floated on the water before Our very eyes The flood was a recompense for the deeds of the disbelievers
We made the story of Noah as evidence of the Truth
However is there anyone who would take heed
How terrible was My torment and the result of their disregard of My warning
We have made the Quran easy to understand but is there anyone who would pay attention
The people of Ad rejected Our guidance
How terrible was My torment and the result of their disregard of My warning
On an unfortunate day We sent upon them a continuous violent wind
which hurled people around like uprooted trunks of palmtrees
How terrible was Our torment and the result of their disregard of Our warning
We have made the Quran easy to understand but is there anyone who would pay attention
The people of Thamud rejected Our warnings
They said Should we follow only one person among us
We shall be clearly in error and in trouble if we do so
How is it that he has received guidance
In fact he is the most untruthfull and arrogant person
We told Salih Tomorrow they will know who is the most arrogant liar
We are sending the shecamel to them to test them
So watch them and be patient
Tell them that each one of them has the right to have a certain share of water
They called together their companions and agreed to slay the shecamel
How terrible was My punishment and warning
We sent upon them a single blast of sound and they were left like hay to be used by the cattle
We made the Quran easy to understand but is there anyone who would take heed
The people of Lot rejected Our warning
We sent down upon them a violent sandstorm which destroyed them all except for the family of Lot whom We saved in the early morning by Our favor
Thus do We recompense the grateful ones
Lot warned them against Our torment but they persistently disputed it
They demanded that he turn over his guests to them
We struck their faces blinded them and said Suffer Our torment of which you were warned
One early morning Our torment brought upon them utter destruction We said Suffer Our torment of which you were warned
We have made the Quran easy to understand but is there anyone who would pay attention
The Pharaoh and his people had also received Our warning
but they rejected all Our miracles
So We seized them in the way that a Majestic and Allpowerful One would
Are you disbelievers mightier than those of the nations which We destroyed before or have you received amnesty through the ancient Scriptures
Do they say We shall be victorious because we are united
Let them know that this united group will soon run away in defeat
In fact the Hour of Doom is the time for them to suffer
The suffering of this hour is the most calamitous and the most bitter of all suffering
The sinful ones will face the destructive torment of hell
when they will be dragged on their faces into the fire and will be told Feel the touch of hell
We have created everything to fulfill a certain purpose
It takes only a single command from Us to bring the Day of Judgment and that can be achieved within the twinkling of an eye
We destroyed many people like you disbelievers but is there anyone who would take heed of Our warning
Whatever they have done has been recorded in the Books records of the deeds
Every small or great deed is written down
The pious ones will live in Paradise wherein streams flow
honorably seated in the presence of the Alldominant King
The Beneficent God
has taught the Quran to Muhammad
He created the human being
and has taught him intelligible speech
The sun and moon rotate in a predestined orbit
The plants and trees prostrate before Him
He raised the heavens and set up everything in balance
so that you would maintain justice
Therefore maintain just measure and do not transgress against the Balance
He spread out the earth for the people
There exists all kinds of fruits palmtrees with sheathed blossoms
grain with its husk and aromatic herbs
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you deny
He created the human being from clay like that used for pottery
and jinn from the many colored flames of fire
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you deny
He is the Lord of the East and West through all seasons
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
He has made the two oceans meet each other
but has created a barrier between them so that they will not merge totally
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
From the two oceans comes pearls and coral
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
By His command the ships with raised masts sail on the sea like mountains
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
Everyone on earth is destined to die
Only the Supreme Essence of your Glorious and Gracious Lord will remain forever
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
Everyone in the heavens and the earth depends on Him
His task in preserving His creation is continuous
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
Jinn and mankind We shall certainly settle your accounts
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Jinn and mankind if you can penetrate the diameters of the heavens and the earth do so but you cannot do so without power and authority
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Flames of fire and molten brass will be released against you and you will not be able to protect yourselves
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
On the Day of Judgment when the heavens are rent asunder they will have a flowery color and flow like oil
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
On that day there will be no need to ask mankind or jinn about his sin
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
The guilty ones will be recognized by their faces and will be seized by their forelocks and feet
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord do you then deny
The guilty ones will be told This is hell which the sinful ones denied
They will run around in blazing fire and boiling water
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Those who fear their Lord will have two gardens
jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
full of various trees
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
In the two gardens there will be two flowing springs
Jinn and mankind which of the favors would you then deny
In them there are pairs of each kind of fruit
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
The dwellers of Paradise will recline on couches lined with silk brocade and it will be easy to reach the ripe fruits from the two gardens
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
There will be bashful maidens untouched by mankind or jinn before
jinn and mankindîwhich of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
who are as beautiful as rubies and pearls
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Can any thing else be a response to a favor but a favor
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Besides this there will be two other gardens
jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
dark green in color
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
In these there will also be two springs gushing forth
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
In both gardens there will be fruits palmtrees and pomegranates
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
There will be welldisciplined beautiful maidens
jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
with big black and white beautiful eyes dwelling in tents
jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
untouched by jinn or mankind before
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
They will be reclining on plain green and beautifully printed cushions
Jinn and mankind which of the favors of your Lord would you then deny
Blessed is the Name of your Lord the Lord of Glory and Grace
When the inevitable event comes
no soul will deny its coming
It will abase some and exalt others
When the earth is violently shaken
and the mountains crumbled
they will become like dust scattered around
On that day you mankind will be divided into three groups
The people of the right hand those whose books of records will be placed in their right hands
How happy they will be
The people of the left hand those whose books of records will be placed in their left hands
How miserable they will be
The foremost ones in faith and virtue the foremost ones in receiving their reward
The foremost ones will be the nearest ones to God
in the beautiful Paradise
Many of them will be from the ancient people
and only a few of them from the later generations
They will recline on jewelled couches
facing one another
Immortal youths will serve them
with goblets jugs and cups of crystal clear wine
which will not cause them any intoxication or illness
Also they will be served with the fruits of their choice
and the flesh of birds as they desire
They will have maidens with large lovely black and white eyes
like pearls preserved in their shells
as reward for their deeds
They will not hear any unnecessary or sinful talk
except each other s greetings of Peace be with you
As for the people of the right hand how happy they will be
They will live amid the thornless lot trees
and banana trees
with fruits piled up one on the other
and amid the extended shade
near to flowing water
and abundant fruits
undiminished and never denied
and the noble maidens
that We have created for the people of the right hand
We have made them virgins
loving and of equal age
These people of the right hand consist of many from the ancient
and many from the later generations
As for the people on the left hand how miserable they will be
They will live amid the scorching
scalding water and under a shadow of black smoke
neither cold nor graceful in shape
They had lived in luxury before this
and persisted in heinous sins
It was they who said Shall we be resurrected after we die and have turned into dust and bones
Will our ancient forefathers be resurrected too
Muhammad say All the ancient and later generations
will be brought together for an appointment on an appointed day
Then you people who had gone astray and rejected the Truth
will eat from the fruit of the tree of Zaqqum
filling your bellies with it
and on top of this you will drink boiling water
like a thirsty camel
Such will be their dwelling on the Day of Judgment
It is We who have created you
Why then did you not testify to the Truth
Have you seen sperm
Did you create it or was it We who created it
We have destined death for you and no one can challenge Us
in replacing you with another creation like you changing you into a form which you do not know
You certainly knew about your first development
Why do you not take heed
Have you seen what you sow
Do you make it grow or is it We who make it grow
Had We wanted We could have crushed it to bits and you would have been left to lament
crying We have been left to suffer loss
Surely we have been deprived of the benefits
Have you seen the water which you drink
Is it you who sent it down from the clouds or is it We who have sent it down
Had We wanted We could have made it salty
Why then do you not give thanks
Have you seen the fire which you kindle
Is it you who have produced its tree or is it We who have produced it
It is We who have made it as a reminder and a means of comfort for the people
Muhammad glorify your Lord the Great One
I do not need to swear by the setting of the stars
which is indeed a great oath if only you knew it
that this is an honorable Quran
preserved in a hidden Book which
no one can touch it except the purified ones
This Quran is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
Would you say that this statement is a lie
Would you reject the sustenance that you receive rather than give thanks
Why can you not help a soul dying
right before your very eyes
We are closer to him than you but you cannot see
If you are true to your claim that there is no Day of Judgment
why can you not bring it the soul back to life
If a dying soul is of those near to God
it will have rest happiness and a beautiful Paradise
If it is of the people of the right hand
it will be with the people of the right hand living in peace and security
If it is of those who have rejected the Truth and have gone astray
its dwelling will be boiling water
and the heat of hell fire
This is the absolute Truth and certainty
So glorify the name of your Lord the Great One
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God
He is Majestic and Allwise
To Him belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He gives life and causes things to die
He has power over all things
He is the First the Last the Manifest and the Unseen and He knows all things
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established His Dominion over the Throne
He knows whatever enters into the earth what comes out of it what descends from the sky and what ascends to it
He is with you wherever you may be and He is Well Aware of what you do
To Him belong the heavens and the earth and to Him all things return
He causes night to enter into day and day into night
He knows best what all hearts contain
Have faith in God and His Messenger and spend for His cause out of what is entrusted to you
Those who believe and spend for the cause of God will have a great reward
If you are true indeed to this covenant why do you not believe in God when His Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord with whom you have made a solemn covenant
It is He who sends illustrious revelations to His servant to take you out of darkness to light
God is Compassionate and Allmerciful to you
Why do you not spend for the cause of God when to Him belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
Those who spend for the cause of God and fight before victory will have higher positions than those who spend for the cause of God and fight after victory
However to both parties God has promised good rewards
God is Well Aware of what you do
Whoever gives a virtuous loan to God will receive double from Him in addition to an honorable reward
On the Day of Judgment you will see the believers with their light shining in front of them and to their right
They will be told Paradise wherein streams flow is the glad news for you today
You will live therein forever
This is the greatest triumph
On that day the hypocrites will say to the believers Please look at us so that we might benefit from your light
They will be told Go back and search for your own light
A barrier with a door will be placed between them Inside it there will be mercy but outside of it there will be torment
Those outside will call out Were we not with you
Those inside will reply Yes you were with us but you spent your life in disbelief and hypocrisy wished death to Muhammad had doubts about his message and let your longings deceive you until the decree of God came to pass
The devil deceived you about the mercy of God
So on this day no ransom will be accepted from you nor from the disbelievers
Your dwelling will be fire
It will be your friend and a terrible end
Is it not time for the hearts of the believers to become humbled by the remembrance of God and by the Truth which has been revealed so that they will not be like the followers of the Bible who lived before them and whose hearts have become hard like stone through the long years
Many of them are evil doers
Know that God brings the dead earth back to life
We have explained Our revelations to you so that you may perhaps have understanding
The charitable men and women who give a virtuous loan to God will receive double from Him in addition to their honorable reward
Those who believe in God and His Messenger are the truthful ones and are witness to the deeds of others before their Lord
They will have their reward and their light
Those who disbelieve and reject Our revelations shall be the dwellers of hell
Know that the worldly life is only a game a temporary attraction a means of boastfulness among yourselves and a place for multiplying your wealth and children
It is like the rain which produces plants that are attractive to the unbelievers
These plants flourish turn yellow and then become crushed bits of straw
In the life hereafter there will be severe torment or forgiveness and mercy from God
The worldly life is only an illusion
Compete with one another to achieve forgiveness from your Lord and to reach Paradise which is as vast as the heavens and the earth and is prepared for those who believe in God and His Messenger
This is the blessing of God and He grants it to whomever He wants
The blessings of God are great
Whatever hardships you face on earth and in your souls were written in the Book before the creation of the souls
This is certainly easy for God
so that you would not grieve over what you have lost nor become too happy about what God has granted to you
God does not love the arrogant boastful ones who are niggardly and who try to make other people also niggardly
Those who turn away from guidance should know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
We sent Our Messengers with clear evidence to support their truthfulness and sent with them the Book and the Balance so that people would maintain justice
We sent down iron in which there is strong power and benefit for the people so that God would know who would help Him and His Messenger without seeing the unseen
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
We sent Noah and Abraham and placed prophethood and the Book among their offsprings some of whom have the right guidance
However most of them are evil doers
Then We sent Our other Messengers to follow their traditions
After them We sent Jesus the son of Mary to whom We gave the Gospel
In the hearts of his followers We placed compassion and mercy
We did not command them to lead the monastic life
This was their own method of seeking the pleasure of God
Despite this intention they did not properly observe it the monastic life
To the believers among them We gave their reward but many of them are evildoers
Believers have fear of God and believe in His Messenger God will grant you a double share of mercy a light by which you can walk and forgive your sins
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Have fear of God and believe in His Messenger so that the followers of the Bible will know that they can receive no reward from God
They should know that all favors are in the hands of God He grants them to whomever He wants
The favors of God are great
God has certainly heard the words of the woman who disputed with you about her husband and who after not having received a favorable response from you complained to God
God was listening to your argument
He is Allhearing and Allaware
Those who renounce their wives by calling them mothers should know that their wives could never become their mothers
Their mothers are those who have given birth to them
The words that they speak are certainly detestable and sinful
But God is Pardoning and Allforgiving
Those who renounce their wives by calling them mothers and then change their minds about what they have said will have to set free a slave as a ransom and only then will their carnal relations be lawful
This is what you have been commanded
God is Well Aware of whatever you do
If one cannot set free a slave he must fast for two consecutive months and only then can he have lawful carnal relations If this is also not possible he must feed sixty destitute people
This is the command of God so that perhaps you will have faith in God and His Messenger
Such are the Laws of God and those who disbelieve them will suffer a painful torment
Those who oppose God and His Messenger will be humiliated like those who lived before
We have sent illustrious revelations and those who disbelieve will suffer a humiliating torment
On the day when everyone will be resurrected God will tell them about their deeds which He has recorded in their entirety while they themselves have forgotten them
God is the witness over all things
Have you not considered that God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
There is not a single place wherein any secret counsel can take place between any three people without God being the fourth nor five people without His being the sixth nor any gathering of more or less people wherever it may be without His being with them
On the Day of Judgment He will tell them about their deeds
God has the knowledge of all things
Have you not seen those who have been forbidden to have secret counsels violate this prohibition and resume their secret counsels for sinful and hostile purposes and to disobey the Messenger
When they come to you Muhammad they greet you with a greeting with which even God has not greeted you and say to themselves Why has God not punished us for what we say if he is a true Prophet
The heat of hell is a sufficient torment for them
This is the most terrible fate
Believers when you hold a secret counsel let it not be for a sinful hostile purpose or to disobey the Messenger but let your counsel take place for virtuous and pious reasons Have fear of God in whose presence you will all be brought together
Holding secret counsels for evil purposes is a work of satan to cause grief to the believers but he can do no harm to them except by the will of God
Let the believers trust in God
Believers when you are told to make room in a meeting for others do so God will then make room for you
When you are told to disperse do so God will raise the position of the believers and of those who have received knowledge
God is WellAware of what you do
Believers whenever you consult the Prophet offer charity before your consultation
This will be better for you and more pure
However if you do not find anything to give in charity then God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Were you afraid that giving in charity before your consultation would make you poor
Since you did not offer such charity God forgave you for this At least be steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax and obey God and His Messenger
God is Well Aware of what you do
Have you not seen those who have established friendship with the people who are subject to the wrath of God
They do not belong to you nor you to them yet they knowingly try to prove their point by using false oaths
God has prepared a severe torment for them
What an evil deed they have committed
They have made their oaths as a shield to obstruct others from the way of God
They will suffer a humiliating torment
Neither their wealth nor their children will be able to protect them against God
They will be the dwellers of hell fire wherein they will live forever
On the day when God will resurrect them all together they will swear to Him as they swore to you and they will think that they have a good case but they are certainly liars
Satan has dominated them and has made them forget the guidance of God
They are Satan s party and the party of Satan will certainly suffer a great loss
Disgrace will strike those who oppose God and His Messenger
God has decreed I and My Messenger shall certainly triumph
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
You will not find any people of faith in God and the Day of Judgment who would establish friendship with those who oppose God and His Messenger even if it would be in the interest of their fathers sons brothers and kinsmen
God has established faith in their hearts and supported them by a Spirit from Himself
He will admit them to Paradise wherein streams flow to live therein forever
God is pleased with them and they are pleased with God
These are members of the party of God and the party of God will certainly have everlasting happiness
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God
He is the Majestic and Allwise
It is He who drove the disbelievers among the followers of the Bible out of their homes in the Arabian Peninsula as the first time exiles
You did not think that they would leave their homes and they thought that their fortresses would save them from God
The decree of God came upon them in a way that even they did not expect
He caused such terror to enter their hearts that they started to destroy their own homes by their own hands and by those of the believers
People of vision learn from this a lesson
Had God not decreed exile for them He would have certainly punished them in some other way In this life and in the next life they would have suffered the torment of hell fire
This is because they opposed God and His Messenger and whoever opposes God should know that God s retribution is severe
All the productive palmtrees of the Jews hostile to you which you cut down or left untouched were the will of God to bring disgrace upon the evildoers
Since you did not have to exhaust your horses and camels or even fight God granted to His Messenger their property
God gives authority to His Messenger over whomever He wants
God has power over all things
Whatever God grants to His Messenger out of the property of the people of the towns belongs to God the Messenger the kinsfolk the orphans the destitute and to those who may become needy while on a journey so that it will not circulate only in the hands of rich ones among them
Take only what the Messenger gives to you and desist from what he forbids you
Have fear of God God is severe in His retribution
The poor immigrants who were deprived of their homes and property who seek favors and pleasures from God and help Him and His Messenger will also have a share in the said property
These people are the truthful ones
Those who established a community center and embraced the faith before the arrival of the immigrants love those who have come to their town They are not jealous of what is given to the immigrants
They give preference to them over themselves even concerning the things that they themselves urgently need Whoever controls his greed will have everlasting happiness
Those who migrated later to Medina say Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in the faith and clear our hearts of any ill will against the believers Lord You are Compassionate and Allmerciful
Have you not seen the hypocrites who say to their disbelieving brothers among the People of the Book If you are driven out we shall also leave the town with you and we shall never obey whoever seeks to harm you
If you are attacked we shall help you
God testifies that they are liars
If they were to be expelled they would not go with them
If they were to be attacked they would not help them
Even if they were to help them they would run away from the battle and leave them helpless
They are more afraid of you than of God
They are a people who lack understanding
They will not fight you united except with the protection of fortified towns or from behind walls
They are strong among themselves
You think that they are united but in fact their hearts are divided
They are a people who have no understanding
They are like those who a short time before suffered the consequences of their deeds
They too will suffer a painful torment
They are like satan who said to people Reject the faith but when the people rejected the faith he said I have nothing to do with you
I fear the Lord of the Universe
The fate of both of them will be hell fire wherein they will live forever
Thus will be the recompense for the unjust
Believers have fear of God
A soul must see what it has done for the future
Have fear of God for He is Allaware of what you do
Do not be like those who forget about God He will make them forget themselves
These are the sinful people
The Companions of the Fire and the Companions of the Garden are not equal
The Companions of the Garden will achieve felicity
The people of Paradise and hell are not alike the people of Paradise are the successful ones Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain you would have seen it humbled and rent asunder for fear of God
These are parables which We tell to people so that perhaps they will think
He is God the only Lord Who knows the unseen and the seen
He is the Beneficent and Allmerciful One
He is the only Lord the King the Holy the Peace the Forgiver the Watchful Guardian the Majestic the Dominant and the Exalted
God is too exalted to have any partner
He is the Creator the Designer the Modeler and to Him belong all virtuous names
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him
He is Allmajestic and Allwise
Believers do not choose My enemies and your own enemies for friends and offer them strong love
They have rejected the Truth which has come to you and have expelled the Messenger and you from your homes because of your belief in your Lord
When you go to fight for My cause and seek My pleasure you secretly express your love of them
I know best what you reveal or conceal
Whichever of you does this has indeed gone astray from the right path
If they find an opportunity to turn against you they will become your enemies and will stretch out their hands and tongues at you with evil intent They would love to see you turn away from your faith
Your relatives and children will never be of any benefit to you on the Day of Judgment
God will separate you from them
He is Allaware of what you do
Abraham and those with him are the best examples for you to follow
They told the people We have nothing to do with you and with those whom you worship besides God
We have rejected you
Enmity and hatred will separate us forever unless you believe in One God
Abraham told his father I shall ask forgiveness for you only but I shall not be of the least help to you before God
They prayed Lord we have trust in You turned to You in repentance and to You we shall all return
Lord save us from the evil intentions of the disbelievers
Our Lord forgives us
You are Majestic and Allwise
They are the best examples for those who have hope in God and the Day of Judgment
Whoever turn away should know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
God will perhaps bring about love between you and those of the disbelievers with whom you were enemies
God is Allpowerful Allmerciful and Allforgiving
God does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with those who have not fought against you about the religion or expelled you from your homes
God does not love the unjust people
He only forbids you to be friends with those who have fought against you about the religion expelled you from your homes or supported others in expelling you
Whoever loves these people are unjust
Believers when believing immigrant women come to you test them
God knows best about their faith
If you know that they are believers do not return them to the disbelievers
Such women are not lawful for them and disbelievers are not lawful for such women
Give the disbelievers whatever they have spent on such women for their dowry
There is no offense for you to marry them if you agree to give them their dowry
Do not hold unto your disbelieving wives you may get back what you have spent on them for their dowry and the disbelievers may also ask for what they have spent
This is the command of God by which He judges you
God is Allknowing and Allwise
If your wives go away from you to disbelievers who will not give you back the dowry which you spent on them let the Muslims pay back such dowry from the property of the disbelievers which may come into their hands
Have fear of God in whom you believe
Prophet when believing women come to you pledging not to consider anything equal to God not to steal or to commit fornication not to kill their children or to bring false charges against anyone such as ascribing others children to their husbands and not to disobey you in lawful matters accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers do not establish friendship with the people who have become subject to the wrath of God
They do not have any hope in the life to come just as the disbelievers have no hope in those who are in their graves
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God
He is the Majestic and Allwise
Believers why do you preach what you do not practice
It is most hateful in the sight of God if you say something and do not practice it
God loves those who fight for His cause in battlefield formations firm as an unbreakable concrete wall
Moses said to his people Why do you create difficulties for me when you know that I am God s Messenger to you
When they deviated from the right path God led their hearts astray
God does not guide the evildoing people
Jesus son of Mary said to the Israelites I am the Messenger of God sent to you
I confirm the Torah which is in existence and give you the glad news of the coming of a Messenger who will come after me named Ahmad
When this Messenger came to them with all the proofs to support his truthfulness they said He is simply a magician
Who is more unjust than one who creates falsehood against God when he has already been invited to Islam
God does not guide the unjust people
They want to put out the light of God with their mouths but God will certainly make His light shine forever even though the disbelievers may dislike this
It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the true religion to stand supreme over all religions even though the pagans may dislike it
Believers shall I show you a bargain which will save you from the painful torment
Have faith in God and His Messenger and strive hard for His cause with your wealth and in persons
This is better for you if only you knew it
God will forgive your sins and admit you into Paradise wherein streams flow and you live in the lofty mansions of the garden of Eden
This is indeed the greatest triumph
Besides forgiveness you will receive other favors which you will love help from God and an immediate victory Muhammad give such glad news to the believers
Believers be the helpers of God just as when Jesus the son of Mary asked the disciples Who will be my helpers for the cause of God and the disciples replied We are the helpers of God
A group of the Israelites believed in him and others rejected him
We helped the believers against their enemies and they became victorious
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God the King the Holy the Majestic and the Allwise
It is He who has sent to the illiterate a Messenger from among their own people to recite to them His revelations and purify them He will teach the Book to them
and others who have not yet joined and He will give them wisdom Before this they had been in plain error
God is Majestic and Allwise
Such is the favor of God which He grants to whomever He wants
God s favor is great
Those who were to carry the responsibility of the Torah but ignored are like donkeys laden with books
How terrible is the example of the people who reject the revelations of God
God does not guide the unjust
Muhammad ask the Jews If you believe that you are the chosen people of God to the exclusion of all other people wish for death if you are truthful
They will never wish for death because of what they have done
God knows best about the unjust people
Muhammad tell them The death from which you run away will certainly approach you
Then you will be returned to the One who knows the unseen and the seen and He will tell you what you have done
Believers on Friday when the call for prayer is made try to attend prayer remembering God and leave off all business
This would be better for you if only you knew it
When the prayer ends disperse through the land and seek the favor of God
Remember Him often so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
When they see some merchandise or some sport they rush towards it and leave you alone standing Say God s rewards for good deeds are better than merriment or merchandise God is the best Sustainer
When the hypocrites come to you they say We testify that you are the Messenger of God
God knows that you are His Messenger
God testifies that they hypocrites are liars
They have chosen their oaths as a shield for them to obstruct others from the way of God
How terrible is what they do
This is because they accepted the faith and then rejected it
God has sealed their hearts thus they do not have any understanding
Their physical appearance attracts you when you see them and when they speak you carefully listen to them
In fact they are like propped up hollow trunks of wood They are so cowardly they think that every cry which they hear is against them They are the enemy so beware of them
May God condemn them
Where are they turning to leaving behind the Truth
When they are told Come and let the Prophet of God seek forgiveness for you they shake their heads and you can see them arrogantly turning away
It is all the same whether you seek forgiveness for them or not God will never forgive them
God does not guide the evildoing people
It is they who say Give nothing to those who are around the Messenger of God so that they will desert him
To God belongs the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites have no understanding
They say When we return to Medina the honorable ones will certainly drive out the mean ones
Honor belongs to God His Messenger and the believers but the hypocrites do not know
Believers do not let your wealth and children divert you from remembering God
Wwhoever is diverted will suffer a great loss
Spend for the cause of God out of what We have given you before death approaches you and say Lord would that you would give me respite for a short time so that I could spend for Your cause and become one of those who do good
God will never grant respite to any soul when its appointed time has come
God is WellAware of what you do
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify God
To Him belongs the Kingdom and all praise
He has power over all things
It is He who has created you all but some of you have accepted the faith and some of you have not
God is Well Aware of what you do
He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose and has formed you in the best shape
To Him all things return
He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that you reveal or conceal
God knows best whatever the hearts contain
Have you not received the news about the disbelievers living before you who suffered the consequences of their deeds and will suffer a painful torment
This was because their messengers came to them with clear proof to support their prophethood and they said Can mere mortals provide us with guidance
They rejected the Messengers and turned away
God does not need the worship of anyone
He is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
The disbelievers have thought that they would never be resurrected Muhammad
Say I swear by my Lord that you will certainly be resurrected and will be told about all that you have done
All this is certainly very easy for God
Thus have faith in God His Messenger and the Light which We have revealed
God is WellAware of what you do
On the day when We shall gather you all together for the Day of Judgment all cheating will be exposed
Those who believe in God and act righteously will receive forgiveness for their sins
They will be admitted into Paradise wherein streams flow and they will live forever
This certainly is the greatest triumph
As for those who have disbelieved and rejected Our revelations they will dwell forever in hell fire a terrible fate
No one will be afflicted with any hardship without it being the will of God
The hearts of whoever believed in God will receive guidance
God has the knowledge of all things
Obey God and the Messenger but if you turn away know that the only duty of Our Messenger is to clearly preach
God is the only Lord and in Him the believers should trust
Believers some of your wives and children may prove to be your enemies so beware of them However if you would pardon ignore and forgive know that God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Your property and children are a trial for you but the reward which one may receive from God is great
Have as much fear of God as best as you can
Listen to the Messenger obey him and spend for your own sake good things for the cause of God
Those who control their greed will have everlasting happiness
If you give a virtuous loan to God He will pay back double and forgive your sins
God is the Most Appreciating and the Most Forbearing
He knows the unseen and the seen He is the Majestic and Allwise
Prophet and believers if you want to divorce your wives you should divorce them at a time after which they can start their waiting period
Let them keep an account of the number of the days in the waiting period
Have fear of God your Lord
During their waiting period do not expel them from their homes and they also must not go out of their homes unless they commit proven indecency
These are the Laws of God
Whoever transgresses against the laws of God has certainly wronged himself
You never know perhaps God will bring about some new situation
When their waiting period is about to end keep them or separate from them lawfully
Let two just people witness the divorce and let them bear witness for the sake of God
Thus does God command those who have faith in Him and the Day of Judgment
God will make a way out of difficulty for one who has fear of Him and will provide him with sustenance in a way that he will not even notice
God is Sufficient for the needs of whoever trusts in Him
He has full access to whatever He wants He has prescribed a due measure for everything
If you have any doubt whether your wives have reached the stage of menopause the waiting period will be three months This will also be the same for those who do not experience menstruation
The end of the waiting period for a pregnant woman is the delivery
God will make the affairs of one who fears Him easy
This is the command of God which He has revealed to you
God will expiate the evil deeds of those who fear Him and will increase their rewards
Lodge them your wives where you lived together if you can afford it
Do not annoy them so as to make life intolerable for them
If they are pregnant provide them with maintenance until their delivery
Pay their wage if they breastfeed your children and settle your differences lawfully
If you are unable to settle them let another person breastfeed the child
Let the welltodo people spend abundantly for the mother and the child and let the poor spend from what God has given them
God does not impose on any soul that which he cannot afford
God will bring about ease after hardship
How many a town has disobeyed its Lord and His Messenger
For them Our questioning was strict and Our punishment severe
They suffered the consequences of their deeds and their end was perdition
God has prepared severe retribution for them
People of understanding and believers have fear of God
God has certainly sent you a reminder
a Messenger who recites to you the illustrious revelations of God to bring the righteously striving believers out of darkness into light
God will admit those who believe in Him and act righteously to Paradise wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever
God will provide them with excellent sustenance
It is God who has created the seven heavens and a like number of earths
His commandments are sent between them so that you would know that God has power over all things and that His knowledge encompasses all
Prophet in seeking the pleasure of your wives why do you make unlawful that which God has made lawful
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God has shown you how to absolve yourselves of your oaths
He is your Guardian and is Allknowing and Allwise
The Prophet told a secret to one of his wives telling her not to mention it to anyone else
When she divulged it God informed His Prophet about this The Prophet told his wife part of the information which he had received from God and ignored the rest
Then she asked Who informed you about this He replied The Allaware and Allknowing one has told me
Would that you two wives of the Prophet had turned to God in repentance
Your hearts have sinned
If you conspire with each other against him know that God is his Guardian
Gabriel the righteous ones among the believers and the angels will all support him
If he divorces you perhaps his Lord will replace you with better wives either widows or virgins who will be Muslims believers faithful obedient repentant and devout in prayer and fasting
Believers save yourselves and your families from the fire which is fueled by people and stones and is guarded by stern angels who do not disobey God s commands and do whatever they are ordered to do
Disbelievers will be told on the Day of Judgment Do not make any excuses on this day you are only receiving recompense for what you have done
Believers turn to God in repentance with the intention of never repeating the same sin
Perhaps your Lord will expiate your evil deeds and admit you to Paradise wherein streams flow
On the Day of Judgment God will not disgrace the Prophet and those who have believed in him
Their lights will shine in front of them and to their right They will say Our Lord perfect our light for us and forgive our sins
You have power over all things
Prophet fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern against them Their dwelling will be hell fire the most terrible fate
God has told the disbelievers the story of the wives of Noah and Lot as a parable
They were married to two of Our righteous servants but were unfaithful to them
Nothing could protect them from the wrath of God and they were told to enter hell fire with the others
To the believers as a parable God has told the story of the wife of the Pharaoh who said Lord establish for me a house in Paradise in your presence Rescue me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the unjust people
He has also told as a parable the story of Mary daughter of Imran who preserved her virginity and into whose womb We breathed Our spirit
She made the words of her Lord and the predictions in His Books come true She was an obedient woman
Blessed is He in whose hands is the Kingdom and who has power over all things
It is He who has created death and life to put you to the test and see which of you is most virtuous in your deeds
He is Majestic and Allforgiving
It is He who has created seven heavens one above the other
You can see no flaw in the creation of the Beneficent God
Look again Can you see faults
Look twice and keep on looking your eyes will only become dull and tired
We have decked the lowest heavens with torches With these torches We have stoned the devils and We have prepared for them the torment of hell
For those who have disbelieved in their Lord We have prepared the torment of hell the most terrible place to return
When they are thrown into hell they will hear its roaring while it boils
It almost explodes in rage
Whenever a group is thrown into it its keepers will ask them Did no one come to warn you
They will say Yes someone did come to warn us but we rejected him saying God has revealed nothing
You are in great error
They will also say Had We listened or used our minds we would not have become the dwellers of hell
They will confess to their sins but the dwellers of hell will be far away from God s mercy
Those who fear their Lord in secret will receive forgiveness and a great reward
Whether you conceal what you say or reveal it God knows best all that the hearts contain
Does the One Who is Subtle Allaware and Who created all things not know all about them
It is He who has made the earth subservient to you
You walk through its vast valleys and eat of its sustenance
Before Him you will all be resurrected
Do you feel secure that the One in the heavens will not cause you to sink into the earth when it is violently shaking
Do you feel secure that the One in the heavens will not strike you with a sandstorm
You will soon know with the coming of the torment how serious Our warning was
Those who lived before them had also rejected Our warning and how terrible was Our retribution
Did they not see the birds above them stretching out and flapping their wings
No one keeps them up in the sky except the Beneficent God
He certainly watches over all things
Do you have any armies who will help you against the Beneficent God
The disbelievers are certainly deceived by satan
Is there anyone who will provide you with sustenance if God were to deny you sustenance
In fact they obstinately persist in their transgression and hatred
Can one who walks with his head hanging down be better guided that one who walks with his head upright
Muhammad say It is God who has brought you into being and made ears eyes and hearts for you but you give very little thanks
Say It is God who has settled you on the earth and to Him you will be resurrected
They say When will this torment take place if what you say is true
Say God knows best
I am only one who gives warning
When they see the torment approaching the faces of the disbelievers will blacken and they will be told This is what you wanted to experience
Muhammad say Have you not considered that regardless whether God forgives me and my followers or grants us mercy but who will protect the disbelievers from a painful torment
Say He is the Beneficent One in whom we have faith and trust
You will soon know who is in manifest error
Say Have you not thought that if your water was to dry up who would bring you water from the spring
Nun
By the pen and by what you write
Muhammad you are not insane thanks to the bounty of your Lord
You will certainly receive a neverending reward
You have attained a high moral standard
You will see and they will also see
which of you has been afflicted by insanity
Your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path and who is rightly guided
Do not yield to those who reject the Truth
They would like you to relent to them so that they could also relent towards you
Do not yield to one persistent in swearing
backbiting gossiping
obstructing virtues a sinful transgressor
illmannered and moraly corrupt or that because he may possess wealth and children
When Our revelations are recited to him
he says These are ancient legends
We shall brand him on his nose
We have tested them in the same way as we tested the dwellers of the garden in Yemen when they swore to pluck all the fruits of the garden in the morning
without adding if God wills
A visitor from your Lord circled around the garden during the night while they were asleep
and the garden was turned into a barren desert
In the morning they called out to one another
Go early to your farms if you want to pluck the fruits
They all left whispering to one another
Let no beggar come to the garden
They were resolved to repel the beggars
When they saw the garden they said Surely we have lost our way
No we are not lost In fact we have been deprived of everything
A reasonable one among them said Did I not tell you that you should glorify God
They said All glory belongs to God
We have certainly been unjust
Some of them started to blame others
They said Woe to us
We have been arrogant
Perhaps our Lord will replace it with a better garden
We turn in repentance to our Lord
Such is the torment if only they knew that the torment in the life hereafter will certainly be greater
The pious ones will receive a beautiful Paradise from their Lord
Shall We treat the Muslims like criminals
What is the matter with you
How could you judge this to be so
Do you have a book from which you study
that tells you to do whatever you want
Do you have a covenant with Us which allows you to do whatever you want until the Day of Judgment
Muhammad ask which of them can guarantee that on the Day of Judgment
they will receive the same thing that the Muslims will Do they have any witness to such an agreement
Let them bring out such witness if they are truthful
On the day when the terrible torment approaches they will be told in a mocking way to prostrate themselves but they will not be able to do it
Their eyes will be lowered and disgrace will cover them
They had certainly been told to prostrate themselves before God when they were safe and sound
Leave those who reject the Quran to Me and I shall lead them step by step to destruction without their being aware of it
I shall give them respite however My plan is so strong that they will never be able to escape from it
Muhammad do you ask for your preaching any recompense which is too heavy a price for them to pay
Do they possess the knowledge of the unseen which confirms the truthfulness of their belief
Exercise patience until the promise of your Lord to punish the unbelievers comes true
Do not be like Jonah who left his people without the permission of God he wanted them to be punished immediately
and who cried for help to his Lord while imprisoned and helpless inside the fish Had it not been for a favor from his Lord he would have been left out in the open deserving blame for his shortcomings
But his Lord chose him as His Prophet and made him one of the righteous ones
When the disbelievers listen to you reciting the Quran they almost try to destroy you with their piercing eyes
Then they say He is certainly insane
The Quran is nothing but a reminder from God to mankind
The Inevitable Day of Judgment
What is the Inevitable
Would that you knew in detail what the Inevitable is
The people of Thamud and Ad denied the Day of Judgment
The Thamuds were destroyed by a violent blast of sound
The Ads were destroyed by a swift destructive gale
which continued to strike them for seven and eight days so that eventually you could see the people lying dead like the hollow trunks of uprooted palmtrees
Can you see any of their survivors
The Pharaoh those who lived before him and the people of the Subverted Cities all persisted in doing evil
They disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord and He seized them with torment which increased with time
When the flood rose high and covered the whole land We carried you in the Ark
as a lesson for you but only attentive ears will retain it
With the first blast of sound from the trumpet
the earth and mountains will be raised up high and crushed all together
On that day the inevitable event will take place
and the heavens will be rent asunder
and will turn frail losing all force The angels will be around the heavens and on that day eight of them will carry the Throne of your Lord above all the creatures
On that day all your secrets will be exposed
Those who will receive the books of the records of their deeds in their right hands will say Come and read my record
I was sure that the record of my deeds would be shown to me
They will have a pleasant life
in an exalted garden
with fruits within easy reach
Such people will be told Eat and drink with pleasure as the reward for what you did in the past
However those who will receive the books of the records of their deeds in their left hands will say We wish that this record had never been given to us
and that we would never knew what our records contained
Would that death had taken us away for good
Our wealth is of no benefit to us
and our belief has destroyed us
The angels will be told Seize and chain them
then throw them into hell to be heated up therein
Fasten a chain to them seventy cubits long
they did not believe in the great God
nor were they concerned with feeding the destitute
On this day they will have no friends
and no food except pus
which only the sinners eat
I do not need to swear by what you see
and what you do not see
because the Quran is certainly the word of a reverent messenger
It is not the word of a poet but only a few of you have faith
nor is it the work of a soothsayer but only a few of you take heed
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Universe
Had Muhammad invented some words against Us
We would have caught hold of him by his right hand
and cutoff his main artery
None of you would be able to prevent Us from doing this to him
The Quran is certainly a reminder for the pious ones
We certainly know that some of you have rejected it
and on the Day of Judgment this will be a great source of regret for the unbelievers
This is the Truth beyond any doubt
Muhammad glorify the name of your Lord the Great One
Someone has needlessly demanded to experience the torment of God
which will inevitably seize the disbelievers
No one can defend him against God the Lord of the exalted positions
On that Day of Judgment long as fifty thousand years the angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him
Muhammad exercise patience with no complaints
They think that it the Day of Judgment is far away
but We see it to be very near
On the day when the heavens become like molten metal
and the mountains become like wool
even intimate friends will not inquire about their friends
though they may see each other A sinner will wish that he could save himself from the torment of that day by sacrificing his children
his wife his brother
his kinsmen who gave him refuge from hardship
and all those on earth
By no means
For the raging flames of the fire
will stripoff the flesh
and drag into it anyone who has turned away from obeying God
and who accumulated wealth without spending it for a good purpose
Human beings are created greedy
When they are afflicted they complain
but when they are fortunate they become niggardly
except those who are steadfast
and constant in their prayers
They are those who assign a certain share of their property
for the needy and the deprived
who acknowledge the Day of Judgment
who are afraid of the torment of their Lord
the punishment of their Lord is not something for them to feel secure of
who guard their carnal desires
except from their wives and slave girls in which case they are not to be blamed
but whoever goes beyond this is a transgressor
who honor their trust and promises
who testify to what they have witnessed
and finally those who do not miss their ritual prayers at the prescribed times
such people will receive due honor in Paradise
What is wrong with the disbelievers who roam around you Muhammad
left and right in numerous groups
Does every one of them desire to enter the bountiful Paradise
By no means For they know very well out of what We have created them The human being s naturally growing from a living germ without discipline and good deeds will not result in virtue
I do not need to swear by the Lord of the eastern and western regions that We have certainly all the power
to replace them by a better people and none can challenge Our power
Muhammad leave them alone to dispute and play until they face the Day with which they have been threatened
the Day when they rush out of their graves as if racing towards a signpost
with their eyes cast down and covered by disgrace the day about which they were promised
We sent Noah to his people telling him Warn your people before a painful torment approaches them
Noah said My people I am warning you plainly
Worship God have fear of Him and obey me
He will forgive your sins and give you a respite for an appointed time
When the time which God has appointed arrives none will be able to postpone it
Would that you knew this
Noah said My Lord I have been preaching to my people night and day
but it has had no effect on them except to make them run away
Evert time I invite them to Your guidance so that You can forgive them they put their fingers into their ears cover their heads with their clothes persist in their disbelief and display extreme arrogance
I preached to them aloud in public
Then I conveyed the message to them again both in public and in private
and told them Ask forgiveness from your Lord He is Allforgiving
He will send you abundant
rain from the sky
strengthen you by providing you wealth and children and make gardens and streams for you
What is the matter with you that you are not afraid of the greatness of God
who has created you in several stages
Have you not seen that God has created the seven heavens one above the other
and placed therein the moon as a light
and the sun as a torch
God made you grow from the earth He will make you return to it and then take you out of it again
God has spread out the earth
for you so that you may walk along its wide roads
Noah said Lord they have disobeyed me and followed those whose wealth and children will only bring about destruction for them
They have arrogantly plotted evil plans against me
and have said to each other Do not giveup your idols Do not renounce Wadd Suwa Yaghuth Yauq and Nasr names of certain idols
They have misled many and the unjust will achieve nothing but more error
Because of their sins they were drowned and made to enter hell They could find no one to help them besides God
Noah said Lord do not leave a single disbeliever on earth
if You do they will mislead Your servants and will only give birth to ungrateful sinners
Lord forgive me my parents the believers who have entered my home and all believing men and women
Give nothing to the unjust but destruction
Muhammad say It has been revealed to me that a party of jinn has listened to the recitation of the Quran and has told their people We heard an amazing reading
which guides people to the right path and we believe in it
We shall never consider anyone equal to our Lord
our Lord is too exalted to have either a wife or son
The dimwit one the devil among us has been telling confused lies about God
We thought that no man or jinn could ever tell lies about God
Certain human beings sought refuge with certain jinn and this increased the rebelliousness of those jinn
Those people thought like you that God would never send down a Messenger
We went near the heavens but found it to be full of strong guards and shooting flames
We used to sit near by and try to listen to the heavens but shooting flames now await those who try to do that
We do not know whether by this arrangement God intends benefit and guidance for the people of the earth or only evil
As for us some of us are righteous and others are not
We have all followed different ways
We knew that we could never challenge God whether we stayed on earth or fled elsewhere
Now that we have listened to the guidance we believe in it
Whoever believes in his Lord does not need to fear loss or oppression
Some of us are Muslims and some of us have deviated from the Truth
Whoever has embraced Islam has followed the right guidance
However the deviators from the Truth will be the fuel for hell
Had they jinn and mankind remained steadfast in their religion Islam We would certainly have given them abundant water to drink
as a trial for them
God will make those who disregard the guidance from their Lord suffer increasing torment
All the parts of the body to be placed on the ground during prostration belong to God
Do not prostrate before anyone other than Him When the servant of God Muhammad preached his message the jinn would all crowd around him
Muhammad say I worship only my Lord and do not consider anyone equal to Him
Say I do not possess any power to harm or benefit you
Say No one can protect me from God nor can I find any place of refuge but with him
My only means of protection is to convey the message of God
Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger will go to hell wherein he will live forever
On the Day of Judgment when the disbelievers witness that with which they have been threatened they will then know whose helpers are weaker and fewer in number
Muhammad say I do not know whether that with which you have been threatened is close by or whether my Lord will prolong the time of its coming
He knows the unseen and He does not allow anyone to know His secrets except those of His Messengers whom He chooses
He causes angelic guards to march before and after him
Messenger so that He would know that the Messengers have conveyed the message of their Lord
He encompasses all that is with them and He keeps a precise account of all things
You who have wrapped yourself up with a mantle
worship God for a few hours at night
Worship Him for more or less than half of the night
and recite the Quran in a distinct tone
We are about to reveal to you a mighty word
Prayer at night leaves the strongest impression on one s soul and the words spoken are more consistent
During the day you are preoccupied with many activities
Glorify the Name of your Lord the Lord of the eastern and western regions with due sincerity
He is the only Lord so choose Him as your guardian
Bear patiently whatever they say do not yield to them and keep on preaching decently to them
Leave the prosperous disbelievers to Me and give them respite for a little while
We have prepared for them fetters flaming fire
food which chokes them and a painful torment
On that day the earth and the mountains will be violently shaken and the mountains will be turned into heaps of moving sand
We have sent you a Messenger who will witness your deeds just as We sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh
However the Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger and We seized him with a severe retribution
If you disbelieve how will you be able to protect yourselves from the hardships of the day which would even turn children greyheaded
On that day the heavens will be rent asunder This is the decree of God which has already been ordained
This is a reminder
Let anyone who wants seek guidance from his Lord
Your Lord knows that you and a group of those who are with you get up for prayer sometimes for less than twothirds of the night sometimes half and sometimes onethird of it
God determines the duration of the night and day
He knew that it would be hard for you to keep an exact account of the timing of the night prayers so He turned to you with forgiveness
Thus recite from the Quran as much as possible
He knew that some of you would be sick others would travel in the land to seek God s favors and still others would fight for the cause of God
Thus recite from the Quran as much as possible be steadfast in prayer pay the zakat and give virtuous loans to God
Whatever good deeds you save for the next life you will certainly find them with God This is the best investment and for this you will find the greatest reward
Ask forgiveness from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Cloaked one
stand up deliver your warning
proclaim the greatness of your Lord
cleanse your clothes
stay away from sins
and do not think that by doing such deeds you have done a great favor to God
Exercise patience to please your Lord
When the trumpet is sounded
it will be a hard day
and for the disbelievers in particular it will not be at all easy
Leave to Me the one whom I have created all by Myself
and whom I have granted abundant wealth
and children living in his presence
whose life I have made run smoothly
and who still desires more
Never will he receive more
He has been hostile to Our revelations
We shall make him suffer the torment of hell without relief
He planned and plotted
May he be condemned
What an evil plan he has made
May he be condemned again for his schemes He looked around
frowned and scowled
then turned back and swellingup with pride
said This the Quran is nothing but magic inherited from ancient magicians
These are only words from a mere mortal
I shall make him suffer the torment of hell
Would that you really knew what hell is
It leaves and spares no one and nothing
It scorches people s skin
and it has nineteen angelic keepers
We have made only angels as the keepers of the fire for they are the strongest in carrying out Our commands
Our informing people of the numbers of these angels is a trial for the disbelievers It gives more certainty to the people of the Book and strengthens the faith of the believers
The people of the Book and the believers have no doubt about it We have fixed the number to make the disbelievers and those whose hearts are sick say What does God mean by such a parable
Thus God guides and causes to go astray whomever He wants
No one knows about the army of your Lord except He Himself This parable is a reminder for mankind
By the moon
by the retreating night
by the brightening dawn
hell is certainly the greatest calamity
It is a warning for mankind
whether one steps forward to embrace the faith or one turns away from it
Every soul will be in captivity for its deeds
except the people of the right hand
who will be in Paradise
and will ask of the criminals
what led you into hell
They will reply We did not pray
nor did we feed the destitute
We indulged and persisted in useless disputes
and rejected the Day of Judgment
until death approached us
The intercession of the intercessors will be of no benefit to them
If such will be the Day of Judgment what is the matter with them Why do they run away from guidance
like frightened donkeys
running away from a lion
Is it that everyone of them wants to receive a heavenly book addressed to him personally
This will certainly never be the case In fact they are not afraid of the Day of Judgment
There is no doubt that the Quran is a guide
Let anyone who seeks guidance do so
No one will seek guidance unless God wills it
He alone is worthy of being feared and He is the Source of Forgiveness
I swear by the Day of Resurrection
and by the self accusing soul that you will certainly be resurrected
Do men think that We shall never be able to assemble their bones
We certainly have the power to restore them even the very tips of their finger
In fact people want to have eternal life in this world
He asks When will be the Day of Judgment
When the eye is bewildered
the moon eclipsed
and the sun and the moon are brought together
people will say Is there anywhere to run away
Certainly not There will be no place of refuge
The only place of refuge will be with God
On that day people will be informed of all that they had done and all that they were supposed to do
In fact people are wellaware of their own soul
even though they make excuses
Muhammad do not move your tongue too quickly to recite the Quran
We shall be responsible for its collection and its recitation
When We recite it follow its recitation by Us
We shall be responsible for its explanation
Human beings certainly do not want to pay much attention to the Quran In fact they love the worldly life
and neglect the life to come
On the Day of Judgment some faces will be bright
and look forward to receiving mercy from their Lord
Others will be despondent
certain of facing a great calamity
Some people certainly do not believe in it but when a person s soul reaches up to his throat
and the angels say Who will take away his soul
the angels of mercy or the angels of wrath then he will realize that it is time to leave this world
When legs are twisted around each other
that will be the time to be driven to one s Lord
The human being does not want to believe the Truth nor does he want to pray
He rejects the faith turns away
and haughtily goes to his people
Woe to you
Woe to you
For you the human being of such behavior will certainly deserve it
Does the human being think that he will be left uncontrolled
Was he not once just a drop of discharged sperm
God then formed him and gave him proper shape From the human being God made males and females in pairs
Does He then not have the power to bring the dead back to life
There was certainly a time when there was no mention of the human being
We created the human being from the union of sperm and egg to test him
We gave him hearing and vision
We showed him the right path whether he would be grateful or ungrateful
We have prepared chains shackles and flaming fire for the disbelievers
The virtuous ones will drink from a cup containing camphor
which flows from a spring from which the servants of God will drink
The servants of God fulfill their vows and are afraid of the day in which there will be widespread terror
They feed the destitute orphans and captives for the love of God saying
We only feed you for the sake of God and we do not want any reward or thanks from you
We are afraid of our Lord and the bitterly distressful day
God will certainly rescue them from the terror of that day and will meet them with joy and pleasure
For their patience He will reward them with Paradise and silk
They will recline therein on couches and they will find neither excessive heat nor cold
The shades of the garden will be closely spread over them and it will be easy for them to reach the fruits
They will be served with silver dishes and crystal clear goblets
Also there will be crystal clear goblets of silver containing the exact measure of drink which they desire
They will drink cups containing soft flowing sparkling water
from a spring named salsabil
They will be served by immortal youths who look like scattered pearls
If you were to see it you would find it to be a great kingdom with great bounty
They will have fine green silk and brocade and they will be decked with bracelets of silver
Their Lord will provide them with a drink of pure wine
This will be their reward and their efforts will be appreciated
Muhammad We have revealed the Quran to you in gradual steps
So wait patiently for the command of your Lord and do not yield to any sinful or disbelieving person among them people
Mention the Name of your Lord mornings and evenings
Prostrate before Him and glorify Him extensively during the night
These people disbelievers love the worldly life and neglect the terrifying day which will come
We have created them and have given them strength
Had We wanted We could have replaced them with another people like them
This chapter is a reminder
Let those who want seek guidance from their Lord
The virtuous mentioned in this chapter want only what God wants
God is Allknowing and Allwise
He admits to His mercy whomever He wants
For the unjust He has prepared a painful punishment
By the angels sent forth with the commands of God
by the angels as swift as blowing winds
by the angels spreading the words of God far and wide
by the angels who make a clear distinction between right and wrong
and by those who reveal revelations to the prophets
to provide excuses for some and to give warnings to others
that whatever with which you have been warned will inevitably come to pass
Then the stars will lose their light
Heavens will rent asunder
The mountains will be blown away as dust
The Messengers will receive their appointments
If one asks To which day have such calamitous events been postponed
one will be told To the Day of Distinction
Would that you knew about the Day of Judgment
On that day woe will be to those who have rejected God s revelations
Did We not destroy the ancient people
and make others settle after them in their land
Thus do We deal with the sinful ones
On that day woe upon those who have rejected God s revelations
Did We not create you from an insignificant drop of fluid
and place it in a secure place
for an appointed time
Thus did We Plan and how excellent is Our planning
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected the revelations of God
Did We not make the earth as a gathering place
for the living and the dead
place on it high mountains and provide you with fresh water
On that Day of Judgment woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
Proceed to that the Day of Judgment which you have rejected
Proceed to that shadow rising in three columns
which neither gives shade nor protects one from the flames
The fire will shoot out sparks as big as huge towers
and yellow camels
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
On that day they will not be able to speak
nor will they be permitted to offer any excuses
On that day woe would be those who have rejected God s revelations
That is the Day of Judgment We will bring you together with all the ancient peoples
If you have any plans use them
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
The pious ones will rest amid the shade springs
and fruits of the kind which they desire
They will be told Eat and drink in good health as a reward for what you have done
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
Disbelievers eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while
You are certainly sinful ones
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
When they are told to say their prayers they do not bow down in prayer
On that day woe would be upon those who have rejected God s revelations
In which word other than the Quran will they believe
What do they quarrel about
They quarrel about the great news
concerning which they have disputes
What they think is certainly despicable They will soon come to know the reality
Yes indeed before long they will learn all about it
Have We not made the earth as a place to rest
and the mountains as pegs to anchor the earth
Have We not created you in pairs
made sleep for you to rest
made the night as a covering
and the day as time for you to make a living
Have We not made seven strong heavens above you
the sun as a shining torch
and sent down heavy rains from the clouds
to make the seeds plants
and thick gardens grow
The Day of Judgment will certainly be the final appointment
On that day the trumpet will be sounded and you will come to Us in huge groups
The heavens will have openings like doors
The mountains will be driven away and become like mirages
Hell will lie in wait for its prey
It will be a place of return
for the rebellious ones and they will live therein for ages
They will not feel cold nor taste any drink
except boiling water and pus
as a fitting recompense for their deeds
They did not expect such a Judgment
and persistently rejected Our revelations
However We have recorded everything in a book
They will be told Suffer We shall only increase the torment for you
The pious ones will be triumphant
They will have gardens and vineyards
maidens with pearsshaped breasts who are of equal age to their spouses
and cups full of wine
They will not hear therein any unnecessary words or lies
This will be their reward from your Lord a favor from Him and a recompense for their deeds
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
He is the Beneficent God and no one will be able to address Him
On that day the Spirit and the angels who stand in lines will not speak except those whom the Beneficent God has permitted and he will speak the right words
That will be the Day of the Truth
So let those who want seek refuge from their Lord
We have warned you of the approaching torment
On that day a person will see what his hands have committed A disbeliever will say Would that I had been dust
By the angels who violently tearout the souls of the disbelievers from their bodies
by the angels who gently release the souls of the believers
by the angels who float in the heavens by the will of God
by the angels who hasten along
and by the angels who regulate the affairs you will certainly be resurrected
On the day when the first trumpet sound blasts
and will be followed by the second one
hearts will undergo terrible trembling
and eyes will be humbly cast down
The disbelievers say Shall we be brought back to life again
after we have become bones and dust
They have said Such a resurrection will certainly be a great loss
However it will only take a single blast
to bring them out of their graves and back to life on the earth s surface
Muhammad have you heard the story of Moses
when his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa
saying Go to the Pharaoh
He has transgressed beyond all bounds
And say to him Would you like to reform yourself
I shall guide you to your Lord so that you may perhaps have fear of Him
Moses showed him the great miracle
but the Pharaoh rejected it and disobeyed Moses
Then he turned away in a hurry
and gathered his people together
saying I am your supreme lord
So God struck him with the torment of this life and the life hereafter
In this there is a lesson for those who have fear of God
People is your creation harder for God than that of the heavens which He created raised and established
high above
He has made its nights dark and its days bright
After this He spread out the earth
produced water and grass therefrom
then setup firmly the mountains
All this was done as a means of enjoyment for you and your cattle
On the day when the great calamity comes
the human being will recall whatever he has done
Hell fire will become visible for those who would see it
Those who have rebelled
and preferred the worldly life
hell will be their dwelling
However those who had feared their Lord and restrained their souls from acting according to its desires
Paradise will be the dwelling
Muhammad they ask you When will the Hour of Doom come
Muhammad you do not know when and how it will come
This matter is in the hands of your Lord
You are only a warner for those who fear such a day
On the day when they see it it will seem to them as though they had only lived in the world for a morning and an afternoon
He frowned and then turned away
from a blind man who had come up to him
You never know Perhaps he wanted to purify himself
or receive some Quranic advice which would benefit him
Yet you pay attention
to a rich man
though you will not be questioned even if he never purifies himself
As for the one who comes to you earnestly striving for guidance
and who has fear of God
you ignore him
These verses are a reminder
so let those who want to follow its guidance do so
This Quran is also recorded in honorable books
exalted purified
by the hands of the noble virtuous
and angelic scribes
May the disbelieving human being be condemned
What makes him disbelieve
From what has God created him
He created him from a living germ He determined his fate
and made the path of guidance easy for him to follow
Then He caused him to die and be buried
and He will resurrect him whenever He wants
Certainly he has not duly fulfilled His commands
Let the human being think about how We produce his food
We send down abundant water
and let the earth to break open
to yield therein corn
grapes vegetables
olives dates
thickly planted gardens
fruits and grass
These are made so as to be means of enjoyment for you and your cattle
When the trumpet sounds
it will be such a day when a person will run away from his brother
mother father
wife and sons
for on that day everyone will be completely engrossed in his own concerns
Some faces on that day will be radiant
laughing and joyous
but others will be gloomy
and covered by darkness
These will be the faces of the sinful disbelievers
On the day when the sun is made to cease shining
the stars are made to fade away
the mountains are scattered about as dust
the young barren camels are abandoned
the wild beasts are herded together
the oceans are brought to a boil
souls are reunited with their bodies
questions are asked about the baby girls buried alive
such as For what crime were they murdered
the records of deeds are made public
the heavens are unveiled
hell is made to blaze
and Paradise is brought near
then every soul will discover the consequence of its deeds
I do not need to swear by the orbiting
stars which are visible during the night
and sit during the day or by the darkening night
and brightening morning
that the Quran is the word of the honorable angelic mighty Messenger
who is honored in the presence of the Lord of the Throne
obeyed by all creatures and faithful to His trust
Your companion Muhammad does not suffer from any mental illness
He certainly saw him Gabriel high up on the horizon in his original form
He Muhammad is not accused of lying about the unseen
The Quran is not the word of condemned satan
Where then will you go
This is certainly the guidance for all jinn and mankind
So let those who want choose the right guidance
However you will not be able to choose anything unless God Lord of the Universe wills it to be so
When the heavens are rent asunder
the stars are dispersed
the oceans are merged together
and the graves are turned inside out
every soul will see the result of its deeds those recorded before his death and those which will produce either virtue or evil after his death
Human being what evil has deceived you about your Gracious Lord
Who created you proportionately and fashioned you
in whatever composition He wanted
Despite this you deny the Day of Judgment
but you should know that there are angelic guards
watching over you
and these honorable scribes know whatever you do
The virtuous ones will live in bliss
and the evildoers will be in hell
which they will enter on the Day of Judgment
to burn therein
They will never be able to escape from it Would that you knew what the Day of Judgment is
Again would that you only knew how terrible it really is
On that day no soul will be of any benefit to any other soul
On that day all affairs will be in the hands of God
Woe to those who are fraudulent in weighing and measuring
those who demand a full measure from others
but when they measure or weigh give less
Do they not realize that they will be resurrected
on a great day
when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
Woe to them
Let them know that the records of the sinner s deeds are in Sijin
Would that you knew what Sijin is
It is a comprehensively written Book of records
Woe on that day to those who have rejected God s revelations
and those who have rejected the Day of Judgment
No one rejects it except the sinful transgressors
who when listening to Our revelations say These are only ancient legends
They will never have faith
In fact their hearts are stained from their deeds
On the Day of Judgment they will certainly be barred from the mercy of their Lord
They will suffer the heat of fire
and who will be told This is what you had called a lie
However the records of the deeds of the virtuous ones will certainly be in Illiyin
Would that you knew what Illiyin is
It is a comprehensively written Book of records
The ones nearest to God will bring it to public
The virtuous will live in bliss
reclining on couches reviewing the bounties given to them
You can trace on their faces the joy of their bliss
They will be given pure wine out of sealed containers
which have the fragrance of musk
This is the kind of place for which one should really aspire
With the wine is a drink from Tasnim
a spring the nearest ones to God will drink from it
The sinners had been laughing at the believers
When passing by them they would wink at one another
and on returning to their people boast about what they had done
On seeing the believers they would say These people have gone astray
No one has appointed them to watch over the believers
On the Day of Judgment the believers will laugh at the disbelievers
while reclining on couches and reviewing the bounties given to them
Will not the disbelievers then be duly recompensed for their laughing at the believers
When the heavens are rent asunder
in obedience to the commands of their Lord which are incumbent on them
when the earth is stretched out
and throws out of itself all that it contains
in obedience to the commands of its Lord which are incumbent on it the human being will receive due recompense for his deeds
Human being you strive hard to get closer to your Lord and so you will certainly receive the recompense of your deeds
The reckoning of those whose Book of records will be given into their right hands
will be easy
and they will return to their people delighted
But as for those whose Book of records will be given behind their backs
they will say Woe to us
They will suffer the heat of hell fire
They lived among their people joyfully
and had thought that they would never be brought back to life again
This is a fact
Their Lord is WellAware of all that they do
I do not need to swear by the sunset
or by the night in which things all come together to rest
or by the moon when it is full
that you will certainly pass through one stage after another
What is the matter with them Why do they not believe
Why when the Quran is recited to them do they not prostrate themselves
In fact they reject the Quran
but God knows best whatever they accumulate in their hearts
Muhammad tell them that they will all suffer a painful torment
except the righteously striving believers who will receive a neverending reward
By the heavens with constellations
by the promised day
and by the witness Muhammad and that which is witnessed the Day of Judgment
may the people be condemned those who tortured the believers in ditches
by a burning fire
while they themselves sat around it
witnessing what they were doing
The only reason for which they tormented the believers was the latter s belief in God the Majestic and Praiseworthy
and the One to whom belongs the heavens and the earth
God is the Witness of all things
Those who persecute the believing men and women without repenting will suffer the torment of hell and that of the burning fire
As for the righteously striving believers they will live in Paradise wherein streams flow
This is the greatest triumph
The vengeance of God is terribly severe
It is He who creates all things and causes them to return
He is the Allforgiving the Most Loving One
the Owner of the Throne the Glorious One
and the Most Effective in His decision
Have you not heard about the stories of the armies
of the Pharaoh and Thamud
In fact the disbelievers had always rejected Our revelations
However God encompassed their activities
What is revealed to you is certainly a glorious Quran
that exists in a wellguarded tablet
By the heavens and altariq
Do you know what altariq is
It is a nightly radiant star
There is no soul which is not guarded by the two angels who record all of its deeds
Let the human being reflect that from what he has been created
He has been created from an ejected drop of fluid
which comes out of the loins and ribs
God has all power to resurrect him
On the day when all secrets will be made public
he will have no power nor anyone to help him
By the rotating heavens
and the replenishing earth
the Quran is the final word
and it is certainly not a jest
They disbelievers plot every evil plan
but I too plan against them
Give respite to the disbelievers and leave them alone for a while
Muhammad glorify the Name of your lord the Most High
Who has created all things proportionately
decreed their destinies and provided them with guidance
It is He who has caused the grass to grow
then caused it to wither away
We shall teach you the Quran and you will not forget it
unless God wills it to be otherwise
He knows all that is made public and all that remains hidden
We shall make all your tasks easy
Therefore keep on preaching as long as it is of benefit
Those who have fear of God will benefit
but the reprobates will turn away
and suffer the heat of the great fire
wherein they will neither live nor die
Lasting happiness will be for those who purify themselves
remember the name of the Lord and pray to Him
However the disbelievers prefer the worldly life
even though the life hereafter will be better and will last forever
This is what is written in the ancient heavenly Books
the Scriptures of Abraham and Moses
Have you heard the story of the overwhelming event the Day of Judgment
On that day the faces of some people will be humbly cast down
troubled and tired as a result of their deeds in the past
They will suffer the heat of the blazing fire
and will be made to drink from a fiercely boiling spring
They will have no food other than bitter and thorny fruit
which will neither fatten them nor satisfy them
However on that day the faces of other people will be happy
and pleased with the result of their deeds in the past
They will live in an exalted garden
wherein they will not hear any vain talk
Therein will be a flowing spring
raised couches
well arranged goblets
wellplaced cushions
and well spread carpets
Have they not looked at how the camel is created
how the heavens are raised up high
how the mountains are set firm
and how the earth is spread out
Muhammad preach you are only a preacher
You do not have full control over them
However those who turn away and disbelieve
God will punish them with the greatest torment
To Us they will all return
In Our hands are their accounts
By the dawn
by the Ten secret Nights
by the odd and even 8th and 9th Dhilhajj
and by the night when it moves on towards daybreak reward and retribution in the next life is an absolute reality
Is this not a sufficient oath for intelligent people
Muhammad consider how your Lord dealt with the tribe of Ad
the people of the huge columned city of Eram
whose like has never been created in any other land
Also consider how He dealt with the Thamud who carved their houses out of the rocks in the valley
Also consider the people of the Pharaoh who victimized people by placing them on the stake
led rebellious lives
and spread much corruption in the land
Thus your Lord afflicted them with torment
your Lord keeps an eye on all evildoing people
As for the human being when his Lord tests him honors him and grants him bounty he says God has honored me
However when his Lord tests him by a measured amount of sustenance he says God has disgraced me
Since wealth does not necessarily guarantee everlasting happiness then why do you not show kindness to the orphans
or urge one another to feed the destitute
Why do you take away the inheritance of others indiscriminately
and why do you have an excessive love of riches
When the earth is crushed into small pieces
and when you find yourself in the presence of your Lord and the rows and rows of angels your greed for riches will certainly be of no avail to you
On that day hell will be brought closer and the human being will come to his senses but this will be of no avail to him
He will say Would that I had done some good deeds for this life
On that day the punishment of God and His detention will be unparalleled
And His bonds will be such as none other can bind
Serene soul
return to your Lord well pleased with him and He will be pleased with you
Enter among My servants
into My Paradise
I do not need to swear by this town Mecca
in which you are now living
or by the great father and his wonderful son Abraham and Ishmael
that We have created the human being to face a great deal of hardship
Does He think that no one will ever have control over him
He boasts and shows off saying I have spent a great deal of money for the cause of God
Does he think that no one has seen him
Have We not given him two eyes
a tongue and two lips
Have We not shown him the ways of good and evil
Yet he has not entered into Aqaba
Would that you knew what Aqaba is
It is the setting free of a slave
or in a day of famine the feeding of
an orphaned relative
and downtrodden destitute person so that he would be of
the believers who cooperate with others in patience steadfastness and kindness
These are the people of the right hand
As for those who disbelieve in Our revelations they are the people of the left
who will be engulfed in the fire
By the sun and its noontime brightness
by the moon when it follows the sun
by the day when it brightens the earth
by the night when it covers the earth with darkness
by the heavens and that Power which established them
by the earth and that Power which spread it out
and by the soul and that Power which designed it
and inspired it with knowledge of evil and piety
those who purify their souls will certainly have everlasting happiness
and those who corrupt their souls will certainly be deprived of happiness
The people of Thamud rejected the truth as a result of their rebelliousness
when the most corrupt of them incited them to commit evil
The Messenger of God told them This is a shecamel belonging to God Do not deprive her of her share of water
However they rejected him and slew her
So their Lord completely destroyed them and their city for their sins
God is not afraid of the result of what He had decreed
By the night when it covers the day
by the day when it appears radiant
and by that Power which created the male and female
you strive in various ways
We shall facilitate the path to bliss
for those who spend for the cause of God
observe piety and believe in receiving rewards from God
But for those who are niggardly horde their wealth
and have no faith in receiving any reward from God
We shall facilitate the path to affliction
and their wealth will be of no benefit to them when they face destruction
Surely in Our hands is guidance
and to Us belong the hereafter and the worldly life
I have warned you about the fierce blazing fire
in which no one will suffer forever
except the wicked ones who have rejected the Truth and have turned away from it
The pious ones who spend for the cause of God
and purify themselves will be safe from this fire
They do not expect any reward
except the pleasure of their Lord the Most High
and the reward of their Lord will certainly make them happy
By the midday brightness
and by the calm of night
Muhammad your Lord has not abandoned you by not sending you His revelation nor is He displeased with you
The reward in the next life will certainly be better for you than worldly gains
Your Lord will soon grant you sufficient favors to please you
Did He not find you as an orphan and give you shelter
Did He not find you wandering about and give you guidance
And did He not find you in need and make you rich
Do not oppress the orphans
and do not reject the beggars
and proclaim the bounties of your Lord
Muhammad have We not comforted your heart
relieved you of the burden
which had been a heavy weight upon your back
and granted you an exalted reputation
After every difficulty there is relief
Certainly after every difficulty there comes relief
When you are free from your obligations strive hard to worship God
and be devoted to your Lord s service
By the fig by the olive
by Mount Sinai
and by this inviolable city Mecca
We have created the human being in the best form
and We shall make him the lowest of low
except the righteously striving believers who will have a never ending reward
After knowing this what makes you still disbelieve in the Day of Judgment
Is God not the best of the Judges
Muhammad read in the name of your Lord who created all things
He created man from a clot of blood
Recite
Your Lord is the most Honorable One
who by the pen taught the human being
He taught the human being what he did not know
Despite this the human being still tends to rebel
because he thinks that he is independent
However all things will return to your Lord
Have you seen the one who prohibits
a servant of Ours from prayer
What will happen if the praying person is rightly guided
or if he commands others to maintain piety
What will happen if the prohibiting rejects the Truth and turns away from it
Does he not realize that God sees him
Let him know that if he does not desist We shall certainly drag him by his forelocks
his lying sinful forelock
Let him call on his associates for help
and We too will call the stern and angry keepers of hell
Muhammad never yield to him
Prostrate yourself and try to come closer to God
We revealed the Quran on the Night of Destiny
Would that you knew what the Night of Destiny is
Worship on the Night of Destiny is better than worship for a thousand months
On this Night the angels and the spirit descend by the permission of their Lord with His decree to determine everyone s destiny
This Night is all peace until the break of dawn
The disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans disbelieved in Islam only after receiving divine testimony
a Messenger Muhammad from God reciting to them parts of the purified
holy Book which contain eternal laws of guidance
Nor did the People of the Book disagreed among themselves until after receiving the ancient divine testaments
They were only commanded to worship God be uprightly devoted to His religion steadfast in prayer and pay the zakat
This is truly the eternal religion
The disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans will dwell forever in hell they are the worst of all creatures
The righteously striving believers are the best of all creatures
Their reward from their Lord will be the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
God will be pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him
This reward is for those who fear their Lord
When the earth is shaken by a terrible quake
and it throws out its burden
the human being will say in horror What is happening to it
On that day the earth will declare all the activities of the human being which have taken place on it
having been inspired by your Lord
On that day people will come out of their graves in different groups to see the results of their own deeds
Whoever has done an atom s weight of good
will see it and whoever has done an atom s weight of evil will also see it
I swear by the snorting chargers of the warriors whose hoofs strike against the rocks
and produce sparks
while running during a raid at dawn
and leave behind a cloud of dust
which engulfs the enemy
The human being is certainly ungrateful to his Lord
He himself knows this very well
He certainly has a strong love for wealth and riches
Does he not know that on the day when those in the graves are resurrected
and all that is in the hearts is made public
their Lord will examine his deeds
The unprecedented crash
What is the crash
Would that you knew what the crash is
On that day people will be like scattered moths
and mountains will be like carded wool
Those whose good deeds will weigh heavier on the scale
will live a pleasant life
but those whose good deeds will be lighter on the scale
will have hawiyah as their dwelling
Would that you knew what hawiya his
It is a burning Fire
The desire to have more of the worldly gains have preoccupied you so much that you have neglected remembring God
until you come to the graves
You shall know
You shall cetainly know about the consequences of your deeds
You will certainly have the knowledge of your deeds beyond all doubt
You will be shown hell
and you will see it with your own eyes
Then on that day you will be questioned about the bounties of God
By the time of the advent of Islam
the human being is doomed to suffer loss
except the righteously striving believers who exhort each other to truthful purposes and to patience
Woe to every slanderer and backbiter
who collects and hordes wealth
thinking that his property will make him live forever
By no means
They will be thrown into hutamah
Would that you knew what hutamah is
It is a fierce fire created by God
to penetrate into the hearts
It will engulf them
in its long columns of flames
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant
Did He not cause their evil plots to fail
by sending against them flocks of swallows
which showered them with small pebbles of clay
to turn them into something like the leftover grass grazed by cattle
For God s favors to them during their summer and winter journeys
Quraish should worship the Lord of this House
It is He who has fed them when they were hungry
and has made them secure from fear
Have you seen the one who calls the religion a lie
It is he who turns down the orphans
and never encourages the feeding of the destitute
Woe to the worshippers
who become confused during their prayers
who show off his good deeds
and refuse to help the needy
Muhammad We have granted you abundant virtue
So worship your Lord and make sacrificial offerings
Whoever hates you will himself remain childless
Muhammad tell the disbelievers
I do not worship what you worship
nor do you worship what I worship
I have not been worshipping what you worshipped
nor will you worship what I shall worship
You follow your religion and I follow mine
Muhammad when help and victory comes from God
you will see large groups of people embracing the religion of God
Glorify your Lord with praise and ask Him for forgivenes
He accepts repentance
May the hands of Abu Lahab perish
May he too perish
His property and worldly gains will be of no help to him
He will suffer in a blazing fire
and so too will his wife who threw thorns and firewood in the Prophet s way Around her neck will be a rope of palm fibre
Muhammad say He is the only God
God is Absolute
He neither begets nor was He begotten
There is no one equal to Him
Muhammad say I seek protection from the Lord of the Dawn
against the evil of whatever He has created
I seek His protection against the evil of the invading darkness
from the evil of those who practice witchcraft
and from the evil of the envious ones
Muhammad say I seek protection from the Cherisher of mankind
the King of mankind
the Lord of mankind
against the evil of the temptations of the satans
of jinn and human beings
who induce temptation into the hearts of mankind
All praise is due to Allah the Lord of the Worlds
The Beneficent the Merciful
Master of the Day of Judgment
Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for help
Keep us on the right path
The path of those upon whom Thou hast bestowed favors
Not the path of those upon whom Thy wrath is brought down nor of those who go astray
Alif Lam Mim
This Book there is no doubt in it is a guide to those who guard against evil
Those who believe in the unseen and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them
And who believe in that which has been revealed to you and that which was revealed before you and they are sure of the hereafter
These are on a right course from their Lord and these it is that shall be successful
Surely those who disbelieve it being alike to them whether you warn them or do not warn them will not believe
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes and there is a great punishment for them
And there are some people who say We believe in Allah and the last day and they are not at all believers
They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive
There is a disease in their hearts so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied
And when it is said to them Do not make mischief in the land they say We are but peacemakers
Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers but they do not perceive
And when it is said to them Believe as the people believe they say Shall we believe as the fools believe
Now surely they themselves are the fools but they do not know
And when they meet those who believe they say We believe and when they are alone with their Shaitans they say Surely we are with you we were only mocking
Allah shall pay them back their mockery and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
These are they who buy error for the right direction so their bargain shall bring no gain nor are they the followers of the right direction
Their parable is like the parable of one who kindled a fire but when it had illumined all around him Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness they do not see
Deaf dumb and blind so they will not turn back
Or like abundant rain from the cloud in which is utter darkness and thunder and lightning they put their fingers into their ears because of the thunder peal for fear of death and Allah encompasses the unbelievers
The lightning almost takes away their sight whenever it shines on them they walk in it and when it becomes dark to them they stand still and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have taken away their hearing and their sight surely Allah has power over all things
O men serve your Lord Who created you and those before you so that you may guard against evil
Who made the earth a resting place for you and the heaven a canopy and Who sends down rain from the cloud then brings forth with it subsistence for you of the fruits therefore do not set up rivals to Allah while you know
And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant then produce a chapter like it and call on your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful
But if you do it not and never shall you do it then be on your guard against the fire of which men and stones are the fuel it is prepared for the unbelievers
And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds that they shall have gardens in which rivers flow whenever they shall be given a portion of the fruit thereof they shall say This is what was given to us before and they shall be given the like of it and they shall have pure mates in them and in them they shall abide
Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable that of a gnat or any thing above that then as for those who believe they know that it is the truth from their Lord and as for those who disbelieve they say What is it that Allah means by this parable He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it but He does not cause to err by it any except the transgressors
Who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined and make mischief in the land these it is that are the losers
How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life
Again He will cause you to die and again bring you to life then you shall be brought back to Him
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth and He directed Himself to the heaven so He made them complete seven heavens and He knows all things
And when your Lord said to the angels I am going to place in the earth a khalif they said What wilt Thou place in it such as shall make mischief in it and shed blood and we celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy holiness
He said Surely I know what you do not know
And He taught Adam all the names then presented them to the angels then He said Tell me the names of those if you are right
They said Glory be to Thee we have no knowledge but that which Thou hast taught us surely Thou art the Knowing the Wise
He said O Adam inform them of their names
Then when he had informed them of their names He said Did I not say to you that I surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and that I know what you manifest and what you hide
And when We said to the angels Make obeisance to Adam they did obeisance but Iblis did it not
He refused and he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers
And We said O Adam Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous food wherever you wish and do not approach this tree for then you will be of the unjust
But the Shaitan made them both fall from it and caused them to depart from that state in which they were and We said Get forth some of you being the enemies of others and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time
Then Adam received some words from his Lord so He turned to him mercifully surely He is Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
We said Go forth from this state all so surely there will come to you a guidance from Me then whoever follows My guidance no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
And as to those who disbelieve in and reject My communications they are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide
O children of Israel call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and be faithful to your covenant with Me I will fulfill My covenant with you and of Me Me alone should you be afraid
And believe in what I have revealed verifying that which is with you and be not the first to deny it neither take a mean price in exchange for My communications and Me Me alone should you fear
And do not mix up the truth with the falsehood nor hide the truth while you know it
And keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and bow down with those who bow down
What do you enjoin men to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book have you then no sense
And seek assistance through patience and prayer and most surely it is a hard thing except for the humble ones
Who know that they shall meet their Lord and that they shall return to Him
O children of Israel call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations
And be on your guard against a day when one soul shall not avail another in the least neither shall intercession on its behalf be accepted nor shall any compensation be taken from it nor shall they be helped
And when We delivered you from Firon s people who subjected you to severe torment killing your sons and sparing your women and in this there was a great trial from your Lord
And when We parted the sea for you so We saved you and drowned the followers of Firon and you watched by
And when We appointed a time of forty nights with Musa then you took the calf for a god after him and you were unjust
Then We pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks
And when We gave Musa the Book and the distinction that you might walk aright
And when Musa said to his people O my people you have surely been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf for a god therefore turn to your Creator penitently so kill your people that is best for you with your Creator so He turned to you mercifully for surely He is the Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
And when you said O Musa we will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly so the punishment overtook you while you looked on
Then We raised you up after your death that you may give thanks
And We made the clouds to give shade over you and We sent to you manna and quails Eat of the good things that We have given you and they did not do Us any harm but they made their own souls suffer the loss
And when We said Enter this city then eat from it a plenteous food wherever you wish and enter the gate making obeisance and say forgiveness
We will forgive you your wrongs and give more to those who do good to others
But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven because they transgressed
And when Musa prayed for drink for his people We said Strike the rock with your staff
So there gushed from it twelve springs each tribe knew its drinking place Eat and drink of the provisions of Allah and do not act corruptly in the land making mischief
And when you said O Musa we cannot bear with one food therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions
He said Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse
Enter a city so you will have what you ask for
And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them and they became deserving of Allah s wrath this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits
Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Christians and the Sabians whoever believes in Allah and the Last day and does good they shall have their reward from their Lord and there is no fear for them nor shall they grieve
And when We took a promise from you and lifted the mountain over you Take hold of the law Tavrat We have given you with firmness and bear in mind what is in it so that you may guard against evil
Then you turned back after that so were it not for the grace of Allah and His mercy on you you would certainly have been among the losers
And certainly you have known those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath so We said to them Be as apes despised and hated
So We made them an example to those who witnessed it and those who came after it and an admonition to those who guard against evil
And when Musa said to his people Surely Allah commands you that you should sacrifice a cow they said Do you ridicule us
He said I seek the protection of Allah from being one of the ignorant
They said Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is
Musa said He says Surely she is a cow neither advanced in age nor too young of middle age between that and this do therefore what you are commanded
They said Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what her color is
Musa said He says Surely she is a yellow cow her color is intensely yellow giving delight to the beholders
They said Call on your Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is for surely to us the cows are all alike and if Allah please we shall surely be guided aright
Musa said He says Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she should plough the land nor does she irrigate the tilth sound without a blemish in her
They said Now you have brought the truth so they sacrificed her though they had not the mind to do it
And when you killed a man then you disagreed with respect to that and Allah was to bring forth that which you were going to hide
So We said Strike the dead body with part of the Sacrificed cow thus Allah brings the dead to life and He shows you His signs so that you may understand
Then your hearts hardened after that so that they were like rocks rather worse in hardness and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth and surely there are some of them which split asunder so water issues out of them and surely there are some of them which fall down for fear of Allah and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do
Do you then hope that they would believe in you and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah then altered it after they had understood it and they know this
And when they meet those who believe they say We believe and when they are alone one with another they say Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your Lord
Do you not then understand
Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known
And there are among them illiterates who know not the Book but only lies and they do but conjecture
Woe then to those who write the book with their hands and then say This is from Allah so that they may take for it a small price therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
And they say Fire shall not touch us but for a few days Say Have you received a promise from Allah then Allah will not fail to perform His promise or do you speak against Allah what you do not know
Yea whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side these are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide
And as for those who believe and do good deeds these are the dwellers of the garden in it they shall abide
And when We made a covenant with the children of Israel You shall not serve any but Allah and you shall do good to your parents and to the near of kin and to the orphans and the needy and you shall speak to men good words and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate
Then you turned back except a few of you and now too you turn aside
And when We made a covenant with you You shall not shed your blood and you shall not turn your people out of your cities then you gave a promise while you witnessed
Yet you it is who slay your people and turn a party from among you out of their homes backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits and if they should come to you as captives you would ransom them while their very turning out was unlawful for you Do you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the other What then is the re ward of such among you as do this but disgrace in the life of this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous chastisement and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do
These are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter so their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped
And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent apostles after him one after another and We gave Isa the son of Marium clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit What whenever then an apostle came to you with that which your souls did not desire you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew
And they say Our hearts are covered
Nay Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief so little it is that they believe
And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve but when there came to them Prophet that which they did not recognize they disbelieved in him so Allah s curse is on the unbelievers
Evil is that for which they have sold their souls that they should deny what Allah has revealed out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers
And when it is said to them Believe in what Allah has revealed they say We believe in that which was revealed to us and they deny what is besides that while it is the truth verifying that which they have
Say Why then did you kill Allah s Prophets before if you were indeed believers
And most certainly Musa came to you with clear arguments then you took the calf for a god in his absence and you were unjust
And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient
They said We hear and disobey And they were made to imbibe the love of the calf into their hearts on account of their unbelief
Say Evil is that which your belief bids you if you are believers
Say If the future abode with Allah is specially for you to the exclusion of the people then invoke death if you are truthful
And they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have sent before and Allah knows the unjust
And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life greedier than even those who are polytheists every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement and Allah sees what they do
Say Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel for surely he revealed it to your heart by Allah s command verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers
Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibreel and Meekaeel so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers
And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors
What whenever they make a covenant a party of them cast it aside
Nay most of them do not believe
And when there came to them an Apostle from Allah verifying that which they have a party of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing
And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever but the Shaitans disbelieved they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel Harut and Marut yet these two taught no man until they had said Surely we are only a trial therefore do not be a disbeliever Even then men learned from these two magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah s permission and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls had they but known this
And if they had believed and guarded themselves against evil reward from Allah would certainly have been better had they but known this
O you who believe do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement
Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like nor do the polytheists that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten We bring one better than it or like it
Do you not know that Allah has power over all things
Do you not know that Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper
Rather you wish to put questions to your Apostle as Musa was questioned before and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith he indeed has lost the right direction of the way
Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith out of envy from themselves even after the truth has become manifest to them but pardon and forgive so that Allah should bring about His command surely Allah has power over all things
And keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and whatever good you send before for yourselves you shall find it with Allah surely Allah sees what you do
And they say None shall enter the garden or paradise except he who is a Jew or a Christian
These are their vain desires
Say Bring your proof if you are truthful
Yes whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of good to others he has his reward from his Lord and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve
And the Jews say The Christians do not follow anything good and the Christians say The Jews do not follow anything good while they recite the same Book Even thus say those who have no knowledge like to what they say so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ
And who is more unjust than he who prevents men from the masjids of Allah that His name should be remembered in them and strives to ruin them
As for these it was not proper for them that they should have entered them except in fear they shall meet with disgrace in this world and they shall have great chastisement in the hereafter
And Allah s is the East and the West therefore whither you turn thither is Allah s purpose surely Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
And they say Allah has taken to himself a son
Glory be to Him rather whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His all are obedient to Him
Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth and when He decrees an affair He only says to it Be so there it is
And those who have no knowledge say Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us
Even thus said those before them the like of what they say their hearts are all alike
Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure
Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner and you shall not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire
And the Jews will not be pleased with you nor the Christians until you follow their religion
Say Surely Allah s guidance that is the true guidance
And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you you shall have no guardian from Allah nor any helper
Those to whom We have given the Book read it as it ought to be read These believe in it and whoever disbelieves in it these it is that are the losers
O children of Israel call to mind My favor which I bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations
And be on your guard against a day when no soul shall avail another in the least neither shall any compensation be accepted from it nor shall intercession profit it nor shall they be helped
And when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words he fulfilled them
He said Surely I will make you an Imam of men
Ibrahim said And of my offspring
My covenant does not include the unjust said He
And when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a place of security and Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standingplace of Ibrahim And We enjoined Ibrahim and Ismail saying Purify My House for those who visit it and those who abide in it for devotion and those who bow down and those who prostrate themselves
And when Ibrahim said My Lord make it a secure town and provide its people with fruits such of them as believe in Allah and the last day He said And whoever disbelieves I will grant him enjoyment for a short while then I will drive him to the chastisement of the fire and it is an evil destination
And when Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House Our Lord accept from us surely Thou art the Hearing the Knowing
Our Lord and make us both submissive to Thee and raise from our offspring a nation submitting to Thee and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us mercifully surely Thou art the Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
Our Lord and raise up in them an Apostle from among them who shall recite to them Thy communications and teach them the Book and the wisdom and purify them surely Thou art the Mighty the Wise
And who forsakes the religion of Ibrahim but he who makes himself a fool and most certainly We chose him in this world and in the hereafter he is most surely among the righteous
When his Lord said to him Be a Muslim he said I submit myself to the Lord of the worlds
And the same did Ibrahim enjoin on his sons and so did Yaqoub O my sons surely Allah has chosen for you this faith therefore die not unless you are Muslims
Nay were you witnesses when death visited Yaqoub when he said to his sons What will you serve after me
They said We will serve your God and the God of your fathers Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq one God only and to Him do we submit
This is a people that have passed away they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did
And they say Be Jews or Christians you will be on the right course
Say Nay we follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif and he was not one of the polytheists
Say We believe in Allah and in that which had been revealed to us and in that which was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes and in that which was given to Musa and Isa and in that which was given to the prophets from their Lord we do not make any distinction between any of them and to Him do we submit
If then they believe as you believe in Him they are indeed on the right course and if they turn back then they are only in great opposition so Allah will suffice you against them and He is the Hearing the Knowing
Receive the baptism of Allah and who is better than Allah in baptising and Him do we serve
Say Do you dispute with us about Allah and He is our Lord and your Lord and we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds and we are sincere to Him
Nay do you say that Ibrahim and Ismail and Yaqoub and the tribes were Jews or Christians Say Are you better knowing or Allah
And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah And Allah is not at all heedless of what you do
This is a people that have passed away they shall have what they earned and you shall have what you earn and you shall not be called upon to answer for what they did
The fools among the people will say What has turned them from their qiblah which they had
Say The East and the West belong only to Allah He guides whom He likes to the right path
And thus We have made you a medium just nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and that the Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you and We did not make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We might distinguish him who follows the Apostle from him who turns back upon his heels and this was surely hard except for those whom Allah has guided aright and Allah was not going to make your faith to be fruitless most surely Allah is Affectionate Merciful to the people
Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven so We shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque and wherever you are turn your face towards it and those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the truth from their Lord and Allah is not at all heedless of what they do
And even if you bring to those who have been given the Book every sign they would not follow your qiblah nor can you be a follower of their qiblah neither are they the followers of each other s qiblah and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you then you shall most surely be among the unjust
Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons and a party of them most surely conceal the truth while they know it
The truth is from your Lord therefore you should not be of the doubters
And every one has a direction to which he should turn therefore hasten to do good works wherever you are Allah will bring you all together surely Allah has power over all things
And from whatsoever place you come forth turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque and surely it is the very truth from your Lord and Allah is not at all heedless of what you do
And from whatsoever place you come forth turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque and wherever you are turn your faces towards it so that people shall have no accusation against you except such of them as are unjust so do not fear them and fear Me that I may complete My favor on you and that you may walk on the right course
Even as We have sent among you an Apostle from among you who recites to you Our communications and purifies you and teaches you the Book and the wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know
Therefore remember Me I will remember you and be thankful to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me
O you who believe seek assistance through patience and prayer surely Allah is with the patient
And do not speak of those who are slain in Allah s way as dead nay they are alive but you do not perceive
And We will most certainly try you with somewhat of fear and hunger and loss of property and lives and fruits and give good news to the patient
Who when a misfortune befalls them say Surely we are Allah s and to Him we shall surely return
Those are they on whom are blessings and mercy from their Lord and those are the followers of the right course
Surely the Safa and the Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah so whoever makes a pilgrimage to the House or pays a visit to it there is no blame on him if he goes round them both and whoever does good spontaneously then surely Allah is Grateful Knowing
Surely those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that We revealed after We made it clear in the Book for men these it is whom Allah shall curse and those who curse shall curse them too
Except those who repent and amend and make manifest the truth these it is to whom I turn mercifully and I am the Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
Surely those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers these it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and men all
Abiding in it their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be given respite
And your God is one God there is no god but He He is the Beneficent the Merciful
Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the ships that run in the sea with that which profits men and the water that Allah sends down from the cloud then gives life with it to the earth after its death and spreads in it all kinds of animals and the changing of the winds and the clouds made subservient between the heaven and the earth there are signs for a people who understand
And there are some among men who take for themselves objects of worship besides Allah whom they love as they love Allah and those who believe are stronger in love for Allah and O that those who are unjust had seen when they see the chastisement that the power is wholly Allah s and that Allah is severe in requiting evil
When those who were followed shall renounce those who followed them and they see the chastisement and their ties are cut asunder
And those who followed shall say Had there been for us a return then we would renounce them as they have renounced us
Thus will Allah show them their deeds to be intense regret to them and they shall not come forth from the fire
O men eat the lawful and good things out of what is in the earth and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan surely he is your open enemy
He only enjoins you evil and indecency and that you may speak against Allah what you do not know
And when it is said to them Follow what Allah has revealed they say Nay we follow what we found our fathers upon
What and though their fathers had no sense at all nor did they follow the right way
And the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry deaf dumb and blind so they do not understand
O you who believe eat of the good things that We have provided you with and give thanks to Allah if Him it is that you serve
He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that over which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked but whoever is driven to necessity not desiring nor exceeding the limit no sin shall be upon him surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price they eat nothing but fire into their bellies and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them and they shall have a painful chastisement
These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness how bold they are to encounter fire
This is because Allah has revealed the Book with the truth and surely those who go against the Book are in a great opposition
It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the East and the West but righteousness is this that one should believe in Allah and the last day and the angels and the Book and the prophets and give away wealth out of love for Him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and for the emancipation of the captives and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and the performers of their promise when they make a promise and the patient in distress and affliction and in time of conflicts these are they who are true to themselves and these are they who guard against evil
O you who believe retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain the free for the free and the slave for the slave and the female for the female but if any remission is made to any one by his aggrieved brother then prosecution for the bloodwit should be made according to usage and payment should be made to him in a good manner this is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy so whoever exceeds the limit after this he shall have a painful chastisement
And there is life for you in the law of retaliation O men of understanding that you may guard yourselves
Bequest is prescribed for you when death approaches one of you if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives according to usage a duty incumbent upon those who guard against evil
Whoever then alters it after he has heard it the sin of it then is only upon those who alter it surely Allah is Hearing Knowing
But he who fears an inclination to a wrong course or an act of disobedience on the part of the testator and effects an agreement between the parties there is no blame on him
Surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may guard against evil
For a certain number of days but whoever among you is sick or on a journey then he shall fast a like number of other days and those who are not able to do it may effect a redemption by feeding a poor man so whoever does good spontaneously it is better for him and that you fast is better for you if you know
The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was revealed a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction therefore whoever of you is present in the month he shall fast therein and whoever is sick or upon a journey then he shall fast a like number of other days Allah desires ease for you and He does not desire for you difficulty and He desires that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of Allah for His having guided you and that you may give thanks
And when My servants ask you concerning Me then surely I am very near I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way
It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves so He has turned to you mercifully and removed from you this burden so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn then complete the fast till night and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques these are the limits of Allah so do not go near them Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard against evil
And do not swallow up your property among yourselves by false means neither seek to gain access thereby to the judges so that you may swallow up a part of the property of men wrongfully while you know
They ask you concerning the new moon Say They are times appointed for the benefit of men and for the pilgrimage and it is not righteousness that you should enter the houses at their backs but righteousness is this that one should guard against evil and go into the houses by their doors and be careful of your duty to Allah that you may be successful
And fight in the way of Allah with those who fight with you and do not exceed the limits surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits
And kill them wherever you find them and drive them out from whence they drove you out and persecution is severer than slaughter and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it but if they do fight you then slay them such is the recompense of the unbelievers
But if they desist then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And fight with them until there is no persecution and religion should be only for Allah but if they desist then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors
The Sacred month for the sacred month and all sacred things are under the law of retaliation whoever then acts aggressively against you inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on you and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that Allah is with those who guard against evil
And spend in the way of Allah and cast not yourselves to perdition with your own hands and do good to others surely Allah loves the doers of good
And accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah but if you are prevented send whatever offering is easy to obtain and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination but whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head he should effect a compensation by fasting or alms or sacrificing then when you are secure whoever profits by combining the visit with the pilgrimage should take what offering is easy to obtain but he who cannot find any offering should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days when you return these make ten days complete this is for him whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that Allah is severe in requiting evil
The pilgrimage is performed in the wellknown months so whoever determines the performance of the pilgrimage therein there shall be no intercourse nor fornication nor quarrelling amongst one another and whatever good you do Allah knows it and make provision for surely the provision is the guarding of oneself and be careful of your duty to Me O men of understanding
There is no blame on you in seeking bounty from your Lord so when you hasten on from Arafat then remember Allah near the Holy Monument and remember Him as He has guided you though before that you were certainly of the erring ones
Then hasten on from the Place from which the people hasten on and ask the forgiveness of Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
So when you have performed your devotions then laud Allah as you lauded your fathers rather a greater lauding
But there are some people who say Our Lord give us in the world and they shall have no resting place
And there are some among them who say Our Lord grant us good in this world and good in the hereafter and save us from the chastisement of the fire
They shall have their portion of what they have earned and Allah is swift in reckoning
And laud Allah during the numbered days then whoever hastens off in two days there is no blame on him and whoever remains behind there is no blame on him this is for him who guards against evil and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that you shall be gathered together to Him
And among men is he whose speech about the life of this world causes you to wonder and he calls on Allah to witness as to what is in his heart yet he is the most violent of adversaries
And when he turns back he runs along in the land that he may cause mischief in it and destroy the tilth and the stock and Allah does not love mischiefmaking
And when it is said to him guard against the punishment of Allah pride carries him off to sin therefore hell is sufficient for him and certainly it is an evil resting place
And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah and Allah is Affectionate to the servants
O you who believe enter into submission one and all and do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan surely he is your open enemy
But if you slip after clear arguments have come to you then know that Allah is Mighty Wise
They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds along with the angels and the matter has already been decided and all matters are returned to Allah
Ask the Israelites how many a clear sign have We given them and whoever changes the favor of Allah after it has come to him then surely Allah is severe in requiting evil
The life of this world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve and they mock those who believe and those who guard against evil shall be above them on the day of resurrection and Allah gives means of subsistence to whom he pleases without measure
All people are a single nation so Allah raised prophets as bearers of good news and as warners and He revealed with them the Book with truth that it might judge between people in that in which they differed and none but the very people who were given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them revolting among themselves so Allah has guided by His will those who believe to the truth about which they differed and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right path
Or do you think that you would enter the garden while yet the state of those who have passed away before you has not come upon you distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently so that the Apostle and those who believed with him said When will the help of Allah come
Now surely the help of Allah is nigh
They ask you as to what they should spend
Say Whatever wealth you spend it is for the parents and the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and whatever good you do Allah surely knows it
Fighting is enjoined on you and it is an object of dislike to you and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you and it may be that you love a thing while it is evil for you and Allah knows while you do not know
They ask you concerning the sacred month about fighting in it Say Fighting in it is a grave matter and hindering men from Allah s way and denying Him and hindering men from the Sacred Mosque and turning its people out of it are still graver with Allah and persecution is graver than slaughter and they will not cease fighting with you until they turn you back from your religion if they can and whoever of you turns back from his religion then he dies while an unbeliever these it is whose works shall go for nothing in this world and the hereafter and they are the inmates of the fire therein they shall abide
Surely those who believed and those who fled their home and strove hard in the way of Allah these hope for the mercy of Allah and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
They ask you about intoxicants and games of chance Say In both of them there is a great sin and means of profit for men and their sin is greater than their profit
And they ask you as to what they should spend
Say What you can spare Thus does Allah make clear to you the communications that you may ponder
On this world and the hereafter And they ask you concerning the orphans Say To set right for them their affairs is good and if you become copartners with them they are your brethren and Allah knows the mischiefmaker and the pacemaker and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have caused you to fall into a difficulty surely Allah is Mighty Wise
And do not marry the idolatresses until they believe and certainly a believing maid is better than an idolatress woman even though she should please you and do not give believing women in marriage to idolaters until they believe and certainly a believing servant is better than an idolater even though he should please you these invite to the fire and Allah invites to the garden and to forgiveness by His will and makes clear His communications to men that they may be mindful
And they ask you about menstruation
Say It is a discomfort therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean then when they have cleansed themselves go in to them as Allah has commanded you surely Allah loves those who turn much to Him and He loves those who purify themselves
Your wives are a tilth for you so go into your tilth when you like and do good beforehand for yourselves and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that you will meet Him and give good news to the believers
And make not Allah because of your swearing by Him an obstacle to your doing good and guarding against evil and making peace between men and Allah is Hearing Knowing
Allah does not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths but He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned and Allah is Forgiving Forbearing
Those who swear that they will not go in to their wives should wait four months so if they go back then Allah is surely Forgiving Merciful
And if they have resolved on a divorce then Allah is surely Hearing Knowing
And the divorced women should keep themselves in waiting for three courses and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the last day and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation and they have rights similar to those against them in a just manner and the men are a degree above them and Allah is Mighty Wise
Divorce may be pronounced twice then keep them in good fellowship or let them go with kindness and it is not lawful for you to take any part of what you have given them unless both fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah then if you fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah there is no blame on them for what she gives up to become free thereby These are the limits of Allah so do not exceed them and whoever exceeds the limits of Allah these it is that are the unjust
So if he divorces her she shall not be lawful to him afterwards until she marries another husband then if he divorces her there is no blame on them both if they return to each other by marriage if they think that they can keep within the limits of Allah and these are the limits of Allah which He makes clear for a people who know
And when you divorce women and they reach their prescribed time then either retain them in good fellowship or set them free with liberality and do not retain them for injury so that you exceed the limits and whoever does this he indeed is unjust to his own soul and do not take Allah s communications for a mockery and remember the favor of Allah upon you and that which He has revealed to you of the Book and the Wisdom admonishing you thereby and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that Allah is the Knower of all things
And when you have divorced women and they have ended their term of waiting then do not prevent them from marrying their husbands when they agree among themselves in a lawful manner with this is admonished he among you who believes in Allah and the last day this is more profitable and purer for you and Allah knows while you do not know
And the mothers should suckle their children for two whole years for him who desires to make complete the time of suckling and their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the father according to usage no soul shall have imposed upon it a duty but to the extent of its capacity neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child nor a father on account of his child and a similar duty devolves on the father s heir but if both desire weaning by mutual consent and counsel there is no blame on them and if you wish to engage a wetnurse for your children there is no blame on you so long as you pay what you promised for according to usage and be careful of your duty to Allah and know that Allah sees what you do
And as for those of you who die and leave wives behind they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days then when they have fully attained their term there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner and Allah is aware of what you do
And there is no blame on you respecting that which you speak indirectly in the asking of such women in marriage or keep the proposal concealed within your minds Allah knows that you will mention them but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful manner and do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is fulfilled and know that Allah knows what is in your minds therefore beware of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving Forbearing
There is no blame on you if you divorce women when you have not touched them or appointed for them a portion and make provision for them the wealthy according to his means and the straitened in circumstances according to his means a provision according to usage this is a duty on the doers of good to others
And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a portion then pay to them half of what you have appointed unless they relinquish or he should relinquish in whose hand is the marriage tie and it is nearer to righteousness that you should relinquish and do not neglect the giving of free gifts between you surely Allah sees what you do
Attend constantly to prayers and to the middle prayer and stand up truly obedient to Allah
But if you are in danger then say your prayers on foot or on horseback and when you are secure then remember Allah as He has taught you what you did not know
And those of you who die and leave wives behind make a bequest in favor of their wives of maintenance for a year without turning them out then if they themselves go away there is no blame on you for what they do of lawful deeds by themselves and Allah is Mighty Wise
And for the divorced women too provision must be made according to usage this is a duty on those who guard against evil
Allah thus makes clear to you His communications that you may understand
Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes for fear of death and they were thousands then Allah said to them Die again He gave them life most surely Allah is Gracious to people but most people are not grateful
And fight in the way of Allah and know that Allah is Hearing Knowing
Who is it that will offer of Allah a goodly gift so He will multiply it to him manifold and Allah straitens and amplifies and you shall be returned to Him
Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of Israel after Musa when they said to a prophet of theirs Raise up for us a king that we may fight in the way of Allah
He said May it not be that you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you
They said And what reason have we that we should not fight in the way of Allah and we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children
But when fighting was ordained for them they turned back except a few of them and Allah knows the unjust
And their prophet said to them Surely Allah has raised Talut to be a king over you
They said How can he hold kingship over us while we have a greater right to kingship than he and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth
He said Surely Allah has chosen him in preference to you and He has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique and Allah grants His kingdom to whom He pleases and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
And the prophet said to them Surely the sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you the chest in which there is tranquillity from your Lord and residue of the relics of what the children of Musa and the children of Haroun have left the angels bearing it most surely there is a sign in this for those who believe
So when Talut departed with the forces he said Surely Allah will try you with a river whoever then drinks from it he is not of me and whoever does not taste of it he is surely of me except he who takes with his hand as much of it as fills the hand but with the exception of a few of them they drank from it So when he had crossed it he and those who believed with him they said We have today no power against Jalut and his forces Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah s permission and Allah is with the patient
And when they went out against Jalut and his forces they said Our Lord pour down upon us patience and make our steps firm and assist us against the unbelieving people
So they put them to flight by Allah s permission
And Dawood slew Jalut and Allah gave him kingdom and wisdom and taught him of what He pleased
And were it not for Allah s repelling some men with others the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder but Allah is Gracious to the creatures
These are the communications of Allah We recite them to you with truth and most surely you are one of the apostles
We have made some of these apostles to excel the others among them are they to whom Allah spoke and some of them He exalted by many degrees of rank and We gave clear miracles to Isa son of Marium and strengthened him with the holy spirit And if Allah had pleased those after them would not have fought one with another after clear arguments had come to them but they disagreed so there were some of them who believed and others who denied and if Allah had pleased they would not have fought one with another but Allah brings about what He intends
O you who believe spend out of what We have given you before the day comes in which there is no bargaining neither any friendship nor intercession and the unbelievers they are the unjust
Allah is He besides Whom there is no god the Everliving the Selfsubsisting by Whom all subsist slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission He knows what is before them and what is behind them and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth and the preservation of them both tires Him not and He is the Most High the Great
There is no compulsion in religion truly the right way has become clearly distinct from error therefore whoever disbelieves in the Shaitan and believes in Allah he indeed has laid hold on the firmest handle which shall not break off and Allah is Hearing Knowing
Allah is the guardian of those who believe
He brings them out of the darkness into the light and as to those who disbelieve their guardians are Shaitans who take them out of the light into the darkness they are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide
Have you not considered him Namrud who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord because Allah had given him the kingdom
When Ibrahim said My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die he said I give life and cause death
Ibrahim said So surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east then make it rise from the west thus he who disbelieved was confounded and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people
Or the like of him Uzair who passed by a town and it had fallen down upon its roofs he said When will Allah give it life after its death
So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then raised him to life
He said How long have you tarried
He said I have tarried a day or a part of a day
Said He Nay you have tarried a hundred years then look at your food and drink years have not passed over it and look at your ass and that We may make you a sign to men and look at the bones how We set them together then clothed them with flesh so when it became clear to him he said I know that Allah has power over all things
And when Ibrahim said My Lord show me how Thou givest life to the dead He said What and do you not believe
He said Yes but that my heart may be at ease
He said Then take four of the birds then train them to follow you then place on every mountain a part of them then call them they will come to you flying and know that Allah is Mighty Wise
The parable of those who spend their property in the way of Allah is as the parable of a grain growing seven ears with a hundred grains in every ear and Allah multiplies for whom He pleases and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
As for those who spend their property in the way of Allah then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or injury they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Kind speech and forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury and Allah is Selfsufficient Forbearing
O you who believe do not make your charity worthless by reproach and injury like him who spends his property to be seen of men and does not believe in Allah and the last day so his parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it then a heavy rain falls upon it so it leaves it bare they shall not be able to gain anything of what they have earned and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people
And the parable of those who spend their property to seek the pleasure of Allah and for the certainty of their souls is as the parable of a garden on an elevated ground upon which heavy rain falls so it brings forth its fruit twofold but if heavy rain does not fall upon it then light rain is sufficient and Allah sees what you do
Does one of you like that he should have a garden of palms and vines with streams flowing beneath it he has in it all kinds of fruits and old age has overtaken him and he has weak offspring when lo a whirlwind with fire in it smites it so it becomes blasted thus Allah makes the communications clear to you that you may reflect
O you who believe spend benevolently of the good things that you earn and or what We have brought forth for you out of the earth and do not aim at what is bad that you may spend in alms of it while you would not take it yourselves unless you have its price lowered and know that Allah is Selfsufficient Praiseworthy
Shaitan threatens you with poverty and enjoins you to be niggardly and Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and abundance and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
He grants wisdom to whom He pleases and whoever is granted wisdom he indeed is given a great good and none but men of understanding mind
And whatever alms you give or whatever vow you vow surely Allah knows it and the unjust shall have no helpers
If you give alms openly it is well and if you hide it and give it to the poor it is better for you and this will do away with some of your evil deeds and Allah is aware of what you do
To make them walk in the right way is not incumbent on you but Allah guides aright whom He pleases and whatever good thing you spend it is to your own good and you do not spend but to seek Allah s pleasure and whatever good things you spend shall be paid back to you in full and you shall not be wronged
Alms are for the poor who are confined in the way of Allah they cannot go about in the land the ignorant man thinks them to be rich on account of their abstaining from begging you can recognise them by their mark they do not beg from men importunately and whatever good thing you spend surely Allah knows it
As for those who spend their property by night and by day secretly and openly they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom Shaitan has prostrated by his touch does rise
That is because they say trading is only like usury and Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury
To whomsoever then the admonition has come from his Lord then he desists he shall have what has already passed and his affair is in the hands of Allah and whoever returns to it these are the inmates of the fire they shall abide in it
Allah does not bless usury and He causes charitable deeds to prosper and Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner
Surely they who believe and do good deeds and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
O you who believe
Be careful of your duty to Allah and relinquish what remains due from usury if you are believers
But if you do it not then be apprised of war from Allah and His Apostle and if you repent then you shall have your capital neither shall you make the debtor suffer loss nor shall you be made to suffer loss
And if the debtor is in straitness then let there be postponement until he is in ease and that you remit it as alms is better for you if you knew
And guard yourselves against a day in which you shall be returned to Allah then every soul shall be paid back in full what it has earned and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
O you who believe when you deal with each other in contracting a debt for a fixed time then write it down and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness and the scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him so he should write and let him who owes the debt dictate and he should be careful of his duty to Allah his Lord and not diminish anything from it but if he who owes the debt is unsound in understanding or weak or if he is not able to dictate himself let his guardian dictate with fairness and call in to witness from among your men two witnesses but if there are not two men then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses so that if one of the two errs the second of the two may remind the other and the witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned and be not averse to writing it whether it is small or large with the time of its falling due this is more equitable in the sight of Allah and assures greater accuracy in testimony and the nearest way that you may not entertain doubts afterwards except when it is ready merchandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to hand then there is no blame on you in not writing it down and have witnesses when you barter with one another and let no harm be done to the scribe or to the witness and if you do it then surely it will be a transgression in you and be careful of your duty to Allah Allah teaches you and Allah knows all things
And if you are upon a journey and you do not find a scribe then there may be a security taken into possession but if one of you trusts another then he who is trusted should deliver his trust and let him be careful of his duty to Allah his Lord and do not conceal testimony and whoever conceals it his heart is surely sinful and Allah knows what you do
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and whether you manifest what is in your minds or hide it Allah will call you to account according to it then He will forgive whom He pleases and chastise whom He pleases and Allah has power over all things
The apostle believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord and so do the believers they all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His apostles We make no difference between any of His apostles and they say We hear and obey our Lord
Thy forgiveness do we crave and to Thee is the eventual course
Allah does not impose upon any soul a duty but to the extent of its ability for it is the benefit of what it has earned and upon it the evil of what it has wrought Our Lord do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake Our Lord do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us Our Lord do not impose upon us that which we have not the strength to bear and pardon us and grant us protection and have mercy on us Thou art our Patron so help us against the unbelieving people
Alif Lam Mim
Allah there is no god but He the Everliving the Selfsubsisting by Whom all things subsist
He has revealed to you the Book with truth verifying that which is before it and He revealed the Tavrat and the Injeel aforetime a guidance for the people and He sent the Furqan
Surely they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah they shall have a severe chastisement and Allah is Mighty the Lord of retribution
Allah surely nothing is hidden from Him in the earth or in the heaven
He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He likes there is no god but He the Mighty the Wise
He it is Who has revealed the Book to you some of its verses are decisive they are the basis of the Book and others are allegorical then as for those in whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical seeking to mislead and seeking to give it their own interpretation but none knows its interpretation except Allah and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say We believe in it it is all from our Lord and none do mind except those having understanding
Our Lord make not our hearts to deviate after Thou hast guided us aright and grant us from Thee mercy surely Thou art the most liberal Giver
Our Lord surely Thou art the Gatherer of men on a day about which there is no doubt surely Allah will not fail His promise
As for those who disbelieve surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against Allah and these it is who are the fuel of the fire
Like the striving of the people of Firon and those before them they rejected Our communications so Allah destroyed them on account of their faults and Allah is severe in requiting evil
Say to those who disbelieve You shall be vanquished and driven together to hell and evil is the restingplace
Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts which met together in encounter one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other unbelieving whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the sight of the eye and Allah strengthens with His aid whom He pleases most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight
The love of desires of women and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well bred horses and cattle and tilth is made to seem fair to men this is the provision of the life of this world and Allah is He with Whom is the good goal of life
Say Shall I tell you what is better than these For those who guard against evil are gardens with their Lord beneath which rivers flow to abide in them and pure mates and Allah s pleasure and Allah sees the servants
Those who say Our Lord surely we believe therefore forgive us our faults and save us from the chastisement of the fire
The patient and the truthful and the obedient and those who spend benevolently and those who ask forgiveness in the morning times
Allah bears witness that there is no god but He and so do the angels and those possessed of knowledge maintaining His creation with justice there is no god but He the Mighty the Wise
Surely the true religion with Allah is Islam and those to whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves and whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah then surely Allah is quick in reckoning
But if they dispute with you say I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and so every one who follows me and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people Do you submit yourselves So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way and if they turn back then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants
Surely as for those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who enjoin justice announce to them a painful chastisement
Those are they whose works shall become null in this world as well as the hereafter and they shall have no helpers
Have you not considered those Jews who are given a portion of the Book
They are invited to the Book of Allah that it might decide between them then a part of them turn back and they withdraw
This is because they say The fire shall not touch us but for a few days and what they have forged deceives them in the matter of their religion
Then how will it be when We shall gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt and every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Say O Allah Master of the Kingdom Thou givest the kingdom to whomsoever Thou pleasest and takest away the kingdom from whomsoever Thou pleasest and Thou exaltest whom Thou pleasest and abasest whom Thou pleasest in Thine hand is the good surety Thou hast power over all things
Thou makest the night to pass into the day and Thou makest the day to pass into the night and Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest without measure
Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather than believers and whoever does this he shall have nothing of the guardianship of Allah but you should guard yourselves against them guarding carefully and Allah makes you cautious of retribution from Himself and to Allah is the eventual coming
Say Whether you hide what is in your hearts or manifest it Allah knows it and He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and Allah has power over all things
On the day that every soul shall find present what it has done of good and what it has done of evil it shall wish that between it and that evil there were a long duration of time and Allah makes you to be cautious of retribution from Himself and Allah is Compassionate to the servants
Say If you love Allah then follow me Allah will love you and forgive you your faults and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Say Obey Allah and the Apostle but if they turn back then surely Allah does not love the unbelievers
Surely Allah chose Adam and Nuh and the descendants of Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above the nations
Offspring one of the other and Allah is Hearing Knowing
When a woman of Imran said My Lord surely I vow to Thee what is in my womb to be devoted to Thy service accept therefore from me surely Thou art the Hearing the Knowing
So when she brought forth she said My Lord
Surely I have brought it forth a female and Allah knew best what she brought forth and the male is not like the female and I have named it Marium and I commend her and her offspring into Thy protection from the accursed Shaitan
So her Lord accepted her with a good acceptance and made her grow up a good growing and gave her into the charge of Zakariya whenever Zakariya entered the sanctuary to see her he found with her food
He said O Marium whence comes this to you She said It is from Allah
Surely Allah gives to whom He pleases without measure
There did Zakariya pray to his Lord he said My Lord grant me from Thee good offspring surely Thou art the Hearer of prayer
Then the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary That Allah gives you the good news of Yahya verifying a Word from Allah and honorable and chaste and a prophet from among the good ones
He said My Lord when shall there be a son born to me and old age has already come upon me and my wife is barren
He said even thus does Allah what He pleases
He said My Lord appoint a sign for me
Said He Your sign is that you should not speak to men for three days except by signs and remember your Lord much and glorify Him in the evening and the morning
And when the angels said O Marium surely Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world
O Marium keep to obedience to your Lord and humble yourself and bow down with those who bow
This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you and you were not with them when they cast their pens to decide which of them should have Marium in his charge and you were not with them when they contended one with another
When the angels said O Marium surely Allah gives you good news with a Word from Him of one whose name is the
Messiah Isa son of Marium worthy of regard in this world and the hereafter and of those who are made near to Allah
And he shall speak to the people when in the cradle and when of old age and he shall be one of the good ones
She said My Lord when shall there be a son born to I me and man has not touched me
He said Even so Allah creates what He pleases when He has decreed a matter He only says to it Be and it is
And He will teach him the Book and the wisdom and the Tavrat and the Injeel
And make him an apostle to the children of Israel That I have come to you with a sign from your Lord that I determine for you out of dust like the form of a bird then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah s permission and I heal the blind and the leprous and bring the dead to life with Allah s permission and I inform you of what you should eat and what you should store in your houses most surely there is a sign in this for you if you are believers
And a verifier of that which is before me of the Taurat and that I may allow you part of that which has been forbidden t you and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord therefore be careful of your duty to Allah and obey me
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord therefore serve Him this is the right path
But when Isa perceived unbelief on their part he said Who will be my helpers in Allah s way
The disciples said We are helpers in the way of Allah We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are submitting ones
Our Lord we believe in what Thou hast revealed and we follow the apostle so write us down with those who bear witness
And they planned and Allah also planned and Allah is the best of planners
And when Allah said O Isa I am going to terminate the period of your stay on earth and cause you to ascend unto Me and purify you of those who disbelieve and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve to the day of resurrection then to Me shall be your return so l will decide between you concerning that in which you differed
Then as to those who disbelieve I will chastise them with severe chastisement in this world and the hereafter and they shall have no helpers
And as to those who believe and do good deeds He will pay them fully their rewards and Allah does not love the unjust
This We recite to you of the communications and the wise reminder
Surely the likeness of Isa is with Allah as the likeness of Adam He created him from dust then said to him Be and he was
This is the truth from your Lord so be not of the disputers
But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge then say Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people then let us be earnest in prayer and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars
Most surely this is the true explanation and there is no god but Allah and most surely Allah He is the Mighty the Wise
But if they turn back then surely Allah knows the mischiefmakers
Say O followers of the Book come to an equitable proposition between us and you that we shall not serve any but Allah and that we shall not associate aught with Him and that some of us shall not take others for lords besides Allah but if they turn back then say Bear witness that we are Muslims
O followers of the Book why do you dispute about Ibrahim when the Taurat and the Injeel were not revealed till after him do you not then understand
Behold you are they who disputed about that of which you had knowledge why then do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge
And Allah knows while you do not know
Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was an upright man a Muslim and he was not one of the polytheists
Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and Allah is the guardian of the believers
A party of the followers of the Book desire that they should lead you astray and they lead not astray but themselves and they do not perceive
O followers of the Book Why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah while you witness them
O followers of the Book Why do you confound the truth with the falsehood and hide the truth while you know
And a party of the followers of the Book say Avow belief in that which has been revealed to those who believe in the first part of the day and disbelieve at the end of it perhaps they go back on their religion
And do not believe but in him who follows your religion Say Surely the true guidance is the guidance of Allah that one may be given by Him the like of what you were given or they would contend with you by an argument before your Lord Say Surely grace is in the hand of Allah He gives it to whom He pleases and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
And among the followers of the Book there are some such that if you entrust one of them with a heap of wealth he shall pay it back to you and among them there are some such that if you entrust one of them with a dinar he shall not pay it back to you except so long as you remain firm in demanding it this is because they say There is not upon us in the matter of the unlearned people any way to reproach and they tell a lie against Allah while they know
Yea whoever fulfills his promise and guards against evil then surely Allah loves those who guard against evil
As for those who take a small price for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths surely they shall have no portion in the hereafter and Allah will not speak to them nor will He look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them and they shall have a painful chastisement
Most surely there is a party amongst those who distort the Book with their tongue that you may consider it to be a part of the Book and they say It is from Allah while it is not from Allah and they tell a lie against Allah whilst they know
It is not meet for a mortal that Allah should give him the Book and the wisdom and prophethood then he should say to men Be my servants rather than Allah s but rather he would say Be worshippers of the Lord because of your teaching the Book and your reading it yourselves
And neither would he enjoin you that you should take the angels and the prophets for lords what would he enjoin you with unbelief after you are Muslims
And when Allah made a covenant through the prophets Certainly what I have given you of Book and wisdom then an apostle comes to you verifying that which is with you you must believe in him and you must aid him
He said Do you affirm and accept My compact in this matter
They said We do affirm
He said Then bear witness and I too am of the bearers of witness with you
Whoever therefore turns back after this these it is that are the transgressors
Is it then other than Allah s religion that they seek to follow and to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and to Him shall they be returned
Say We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes and what was given to Musa and Isa and to the prophets from their Lord we do not make any distinction between any of them and to Him do we submit
And whoever desires a religion other than Islam it shall not be accepted from him and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers
How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their believing and after they had borne witness that the Apostle was true and clear arguments had come to them and Allah does not guide the unjust people
As for these their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of men all together
Abiding in it their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited
Except those who repent after that and amend then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Surely those who disbelieve after their believing then increase in unbelief their repentance shall not be accepted and these are they that go astray
Surely those who disbelieve and die while they are unbelievers the earth full of gold shall not be accepted from one of them though he should offer to ransom himself with it these it is who shall have a painful chastisement and they shall have no helpers
By no means shall you attain to righteousness until you spend benevolently out of what you love and whatever thing you spend Allah surely knows it
All food was lawful to the children of Israel except that which Israel had forbidden to himself before the Taurat was revealed
Say Bring then the Taurat and read it if you are truthful
Then whoever fabricates a lie against Allah after this these it is that are the unjust
Say Allah has spoken the truth therefore follow the religion of Ibrahim the upright one and he was not one of the polytheists
Most surely the first house appointed for men is the one at Bekka blessed and a guidance for the nations
In it are clear signs the standing place of Ibrahim and whoever enters it shall be secure and pilgrimage to the House is incumbent upon men for the sake of Allah upon every one who is able to undertake the journey to it and whoever disbelieves then surely Allah is Selfsufficient above any need of the worlds
Say O followers of the Book why do you disbelieve in the communications of Allah And Allah is a witness of what you do
Say O followers of the Book why do you hinder him who believes from the way of Allah
You seek to make it crooked while you are witness and Allah is not heedless of what you do
O you who believe if you obey a party from among those who have been given the Book they will turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed
But how can you disbelieve while it is you to whom the communications of Allah are recited and among you is His Apostle
And whoever holds fast to Allah he indeed is guided to the right path
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah with the care which is due to Him and do not die unless you are Muslims
And hold fast by the covenant of Allah all together and be not disunited and remember the favor of Allah on you when you were enemies then He united your hearts so by His favor you became brethren and you were on the brink of a pit of fire then He saved you from it thus does Allah make clear to you His communications that you may follow the right way
And from among you there should be a party who invite to good and enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and these it is that shall be successful
And be not like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them and these it is that shall have a grievous chastisement
On the day when some faces shall turn white and some faces shall turn black then as to those whose faces turn black Did you disbelieve after your believing
Taste therefore the chastisement because you disbelieved
And as to those whose faces turn white they shall be in Allah s mercy in it they shallabide
These are the communications of Allah which We recite to you with truth and Allah does not desire any injustice to the creatures
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and to Allah all things return
You are the best of the nations raised up for the benefit of men you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in Allah and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them of them some are believers and most of them are transgressors
They shall by no means harm you but with a slight evil and if they fight with you they shall turn their backs to you then shall they not be helped
Abasement is made to cleave to them wherever they are found except under a covenant with Allah and a covenant with men and they have become deserving of wrath from Allah and humiliation is made to cleave to them this is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and slew the prophets unjustly this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits
They are not all alike of the followers of the Book there is an upright party they recite Allah s communications in the nighttime and they adore Him
They believe in Allah and the last day and they enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and they strive with one another in hastening to good deeds and those are among the good
And whatever good they do they shall not be denied it and Allah knows those who guard against evil
As for those who disbelieve surely neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them in the least against Allah and these are the inmates of the fire therein they shall abide
The likeness of what they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold that smites the seed produce of a people who have done injustice to their souls and destroys it and Allah is not unjust to them but they are unjust to themselves
O you who believe do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you they love what distresses you vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths and what their breasts conceal is greater still indeed We have made the communications clear to you if you will understand
Lo you are they who will love them while they do not love you and you believe in the Book in the whole of it and when they meet you they say We believe and when they are alone they bite the ends of their fingers in rage against you Say Die in your rage surely Allah knows what is in the breasts
If good befalls you it grieves them and if an evil afflicts you they rejoice at it and if you are patient and guard yourselves their scheme will not injure you in any way surely Allah comprehends what they do
And when you did go forth early in the morning from your family to lodge the believers in encampments for war and Allah is Hearing Knowing
When two parties from among you had determined that they should show cowardice and Allah was the guardian of them both and in Allah should the believers trust
And Allah did certainly assist you at Badr when you were weak be careful of your duty to Allah then that you may give thanks
When you said to the believers Does it not suffice you that your Lord should assist you with three thousand of the angels sent down
Yea if you remain patient and are on your guard and they come upon you in a headlong manner your Lord will assist you with five thousand of the havocmaking angels
And Allah did not make it but as good news for you and that your hearts might be at ease thereby and victory is only from Allah the Mighty the Wise
That He may cut off a portion from among those who disbelieve or abase them so that they should return disappointed of attaining what they desired
You have no concern in the affair whether He turns to them mercifully or chastises them for surely they are unjust
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe do not devour usury making it double and redouble and be careful of your duty to Allah that you may be successful
And guard yourselves against the fire which has been prepared for the unbelievers
And obey Allah and the Apostle that you may be shown mercy
And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden the extensiveness of which is as the heavens and the earth it is prepared for those who guard against evil
Those who spend benevolently in ease as well as in straitness and those who restrain their anger and pardon men and Allah loves the doers of good to others
And those who when they commit an indecency or do injustice to their souls remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their faults and who forgives the faults but Allah and who do not knowingly persist in what they have done
As for these their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them and excellent is the reward of the laborers
Indeed there have been examples before you therefore travel in the earth and see what was the end of the rejecters
This is a clear statement for men and a guidance and an admonition to those who guard against evil
And be not infirm and be not grieving and you shall have the upper hand if you are believers
If a wound has afflicted you at Ohud a wound like it has also afflicted the unbelieving people and We bring these days to men by turns and that Allah may know those who believe and take witnesses from among you and Allah does not love the unjust
And that He may purge those who believe and deprive the unbelievers of blessings
Do you think that you will enter the garden while Allah has not yet known those who strive hard from among you and He has not known the patient
And certainly you desired death before you met it so indeed you have seen it and you look at it
And Muhammad is no more than an apostle the apostles have already passed away before him if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels And whoever turns back upon his heels he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful
And a soul will not die but with the permission of Allah the term is fixed and whoever desires the reward of this world I shall give him of it and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter I shall give him of it and I will reward the grateful
And how many a prophet has fought with whom were many worshippers of the Lord so they did not become weakhearted on account of what befell them in Allah s way nor did they weaken nor did they abase themselves and Allah loves the patient
And their saying was no other than that they said Our Lord forgive us our faults and our extravagance in our affair and make firm our feet and help us against the unbelieving people
So Allah gave them the reward of this world and better reward of the hereafter and Allah loves those who do good to others
O you who believe if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back upon your heels so you will turn back losers
Nay Allah is your Patron and He is the best of the helpers
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they set up with Allah that for which He has sent down no authority and their abode is the fire and evil is the abode of the unjust
And certainly Allah made good to you His promise when you slew them by His permission until when you became weakhearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved of you were some who desired this world and of you were some who desired the hereafter then He turned you away from them that He might try you and He has certainly pardoned you and Allah is Gracious to the believers
When you ran off precipitately and did not wait for any one and the Apostle was calling you from your rear so He gave you another sorrow instead of your sorrow so that you might not grieve at what had escaped you nor at what befell you and Allah is aware of what you do
Then after sorrow He sent down security upon you a calm coming upon a party of you and there was another party whom their own souls had rendered anxious they entertained about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly saying We have no hand in the affair
Say Surely the affair is wholly in the hands of Allah
They conceal within their souls what they would not reveal to you They say Had we any hand in the affair we would not have been slain here
Say Had you remained in your houses those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain and that Allah might test what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts and Allah knows what is in the breasts
As for those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met only the Shaitan sought to cause them to make a slip on account of some deeds they had done and certainly Allah has pardoned them surely Allah is Forgiving Forbearing
O you who believe be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in fighting Had they been with us they would not have died and they would not have been slain so Allah makes this to be an intense regret in their hearts and Allah gives life and causes death and Allah sees what you do
And if you are slain in the way of Allah or you die certainly forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what they amass
And if indeed you die or you are slain certainly to Allah shall you be gathered together
Thus it is due to mercy from Allah that you deal with them gently and had you been rough hard hearted they would certainly have dispersed from around you pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them and take counsel with them in the affair so when you have decided then place your trust in Allah surely Allah loves those who trust
If Allah assists you then there is none that can overcome you and if He forsakes you who is there then that can assist you after Him
And on Allah should the believers rely
And it is not attributable to a prophet that he should act unfaithfully and he who acts unfaithfully shall bring that in respect of which he has acted unfaithfully on the day of resurrection then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has earned and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Is then he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who has made himself deserving of displeasure from Allah and his abode is hell and it is an evil destination
There are varying grades with Allah and Allah sees what they do
Certainly Allah conferred a benefit upon the believers when He raised among them an Apostle from among themselves reciting to them His communications and purifying them and teaching them the Book and the wisdom although before that they were surely in manifest error
What when a misfortune befell you and you had certainly afflicted the unbelievers with twice as much you began to say Whence is this
Say It is from yourselves surely Allah has power over all things
And what befell you on the day when the two armies met at Ohud was with Allah s knowledge and that He might know the believers
And that He might know the hypocrites and it was said to them Come fight in Allah s way or defend yourselves
They said If we knew fighting we would certainly have followed you
They were on that day much nearer to unbelief than to belief
They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts and Allah best knows what they conceal
Those who said of their brethren whilst they themselves held back Had they obeyed us they would not have been killed Say Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth
And reckon not those who are killed in Allah s way as dead nay they are alive and are provided sustenance from their Lord
Rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His grace and they rejoice for the sake of those who being left behind them have not yet joined them that they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
They rejoice on account of favor from Allah and His grace and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers
As for those who responded at Ohud to the call of Allah and the Apostle after the wound had befallen them those among them who do good to others and guard against evil shall have a great reward
Those to whom the people said Surely men have gathered against you therefore fear them but this increased their faith and they said Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector
So they returned with favor from Allah and His grace no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of Allah and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
It is only the Shaitan that causes you to fear from his friends but do not fear them and fear Me if you are believers
And let not those grieve you who fall into unbelief hastily surely they can do no harm to Allah at all Allah intends that He should not give them any portion in the hereafter and they shall have a grievous chastisement
Surely those who have bought unbelief at the price of faith shall do no harm at all to Allah and they shall have a painful chastisement
And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for their souls We grant them respite only that they may add to their sins and they shall have a disgraceful chastisement
On no account will Allah leave the believers in the condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the good nor is Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen but Allah chooses of His apostles whom He pleases therefore believe in Allah and His apostles and if you believe and guard against evil then you shall have a great reward
And let not those deem who are niggardly in giving away that which Allah has granted them out of His grace that it is good for them nay it is worse for them they shall have that whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the resurrection day and Allah s is the heritage of the heavens and the earth and Allah is aware of what you do
Allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said Surely Allah is poor and we are rich
I will record what they say and their killing the prophets unjustly and I will say Taste the chastisement of burning
This is for what your own hands have sent before and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants
Those are they who said Surely Allah has enjoined us that we should not believe in any apostle until he brings us an offering which the fire consumes Say Indeed there came to you apostles before me with clear arguments and with that which you demand why then did you kill them if you are truthful
But if they reject you so indeed were rejected before you apostles who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating book
Every soul shall taste of death and you shall only be paid fully your reward on the resurrection day then whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden he indeed has attained the object and the life of this world is nothing but a provision of vanities
You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and your souls and you shall certainly hear from those who have been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists much annoying talk and if you are patient and guard against evil surely this is one of the affairs which should be determined upon
And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it so evil is that which they buy
Do not think those who rejoice for what they have done and love that they should be praised for what they have not done so do by no means think them to be safe from the chastisement and they shall have a painful chastisement
And Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and Allah has power over all things
Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day there are signs for men who understand
Those who remember Allah standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth Our Lord
Thou hast not created this in vain
Glory be to Thee save us then from the chastisement of the fire
Our Lord surely whomsoever Thou makest enter the fire him Thou hast indeed brought to disgrace and there shall be no helpers for the unjust
Our Lord surely we have heard a preacher calling to the faith saying Believe in your Lord so we did believe Our Lord forgive us therefore our faults and cover our evil deeds and make us die with the righteous
Our Lord and grant us what Thou hast promised us by Thy apostles and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection surely Thou dost not fail to perform the promise
So their Lord accepted their prayer That I will not waste the work of a worker among you whether male or female the one of you being from the other they therefore who fled and were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and who fought and were slain I will most certainly cover their evil deeds and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow a reward from Allah and with Allah is yet better reward
Let it not deceive you that those who disbelieve go to and fro in the cities fearlessly
A brief enjoyment then their abode is hell and evil is the restingplace
But as to those who are careful of their duty to their Lord they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in them an entertainment from their Lord and that which is with Allah is best for the righteous
And most surely of the followers of the Book there are those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you and in that which has been revealed to them being lowly before Allah they do not take a small price for the communications of Allah these it is that have their reward with their Lord surely Allah is quick in reckoning
O you who believe be patient and excel in patience and remain steadfast and be careful of your duty to Allah that you may be successful
O people be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same kind and spread from these two many men and women and be careful of your duty to Allah by Whom you demand one of another your rights and to the ties of relationship surely Allah ever watches over you
And give to the orphans their property and do not substitute worthless things for their good ones and do not devour their property as an addition to your own property this is surely a great crime
And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans then marry such women as seem good to you two and three and four but if you fear that you will not do justice between them then marry only one or what your right hands possess this is more proper that you may not deviate from the right course
And give women their dowries as a free gift but if they of themselves be pleased to give up to you a portion of it then eat it with enjoyment and with wholesome result
And do not give away your property which Allah has made for you a means of support to the weak of understanding and maintain them out of the profits of it and clothe them and speak to them words of honest advice
And test the orphans until they attain puberty then if you find in them maturity of intellect make over to them their property and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily lest they attain to full age and whoever is rich let him abstain altogether and whoever is poor let him eat reasonably then when you make over to them their property call witnesses in their presence and Allah is enough as a Reckoner
Men shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave and women shall have a portion of what the parents and the near relatives leave whether there is little or much of it a stated portion
And when there are present at the division the relatives and the orphans and the needy give them something out of it and speak to them kind words
And let those fear who should they leave behind them weakly offspring would fear on their account so let them be careful of their duty to Allah and let them speak right words
As for those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they shall enter burning fire
Allah enjoins you concerning your children The male shall have the equal of the portion of two females then if they are more than two females they shall have twothirds of what the deceased has left and if there is one she shall have the half and as for his parents each of them shall have the sixth of what he has left if he has a child but if he has no child and only his two parents inherit him then his mother shall have the third but if he has brothers then his mother shall have the sixth after the payment of a bequest he may have bequeathed or a debt your parents and your children you know not which of them is the nearer to you in usefulness this is an ordinance from Allah Surely Allah is Knowing Wise
And you shall have half of what your wives leave if they have no child but if they have a child then you shall have a fourth of what they leave after payment of any bequest they may have bequeathed or a debt and they shall have the fourth of what you leave if you have no child but if you have a child then they shall have the eighth of what you leave after payment of a bequest you may have bequeathed or a debt and if a man or a woman leaves property to be inherited by neither parents nor offspring and he or she has a brother or a sister then each of them two shall have the sixth but if they are more than that they shall be sharers in the third after payment of any bequest that may have been bequeathed or a debt that does not harm others this is an ordinance from Allah and Allah is Knowing Forbearing
These are Allah s limits and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them and this is the great achievement
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle and goes beyond His limits He will cause him to enter fire to abide in it and he shall have an abasing chastisement
And as for those who are guilty of an indecency from among your women call to witnesses against them four witnesses from among you then if they bear witness confine them to the houses until death takes them away or Allah opens some way for them
And as for the two who are guilty of indecency from among you give them both a punishment then if they repent and amend turn aside from them surely Allah is Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance then turn to Allah soon so these it is to whom Allah turns mercifully and Allah is ever Knowing Wise
And repentance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds until when death comes to one of them he says Surely now I repent nor for those who die while they are unbelievers
These are they for whom We have prepared a painful chastisement
O you who believe it is not lawful for you that you should take women as heritage against their will and do not straiten them in order that you may take part of what you have given them unless they are guilty of manifest indecency and treat them kindly then if you hate them it may be that you dislike a thing while Allah has placed abundant good in it
And if you wish to have one wife in place of another and you have given one of them a heap of gold then take not from it anything would you take it by slandering her and doing her manifest wrong
And how can you take it when one of you has already gone in to the other and they have made with you a firm covenant
And marry not woman whom your fathers married except what has already passed this surely is indecent and hateful and it is an evil way
Forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts and brothers daughters and sisters daughters and your mothers that have suckled you and your fostersisters and mothers of your wives and your stepdaughters who are in your guardianship born of your wives to whom you have gone in but if you have not gone in to them there is no blame on you in marrying them and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins and that you should have two sisters together except what has already passed surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And all married women except those whom your right hands possess this is Allah s ordinance to you and lawful for you are all women besides those provided that you seek them with your property taking them in marriage not committing fornication Then as to those whom you profit by give them their dowries as appointed and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appointed surely Allah is Knowing Wise
And whoever among you has not within his power ampleness of means to marry free believing women then he may marry of those whom your right hands possess from among your believing maidens and Allah knows best your faith you are sprung the one from the other so marry them with the permission of their masters and give them their dowries justly they being chaste not fornicating nor receiving paramours and when they are taken in marriage then if they are guilty of indecency they shall suffer half the punishment which is inflicted upon free women This is for him among you who fears falling into evil and that you abstain is better for you and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Allah desires to explain to you and to guide you into the ways of those before you and to turn to you mercifully and Allah is Knowing Wise
And Allah desires that He should turn to you mercifully and those who follow their lusts desire that you should deviate with a great deviation
Allah desires that He should make light your burdens and man is created weak
O you who believe do not devour your property among yourselves falsely except that it be trading by your mutual consent and do not kill your people surely Allah is Merciful to you
And whoever does this aggressively and unjustly We will soon cast him into fire and this is easy to Allah
If you shun the great sins which you are forbidden We will do away with your small sins and cause you to enter an honorable place of entering
And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of you excel others men shall have the benefit of what they earn and women shall have the benefit of what they earn and ask Allah of His grace surely Allah knows all things
And to every one We have appointed heirs of what parents and near relatives leave and as to those with whom your rights hands have ratified agreements give them their portion surely Allah is a witness over all things
Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property the good women are therefore obedient guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded and as to those on whose part you fear desertion admonish them and leave them alone in the sleepingplaces and beat them then if they obey you do not seek a way against them surely Allah is High Great
And if you fear a breach between the two then appoint judge from his people and a judge from her people if they both desire agreement Allah will effect harmony between them surely Allah is Knowing Aware
And serve Allah and do not associate any thing with Him and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the neighbor of your kin and the alien neighbor and the companion in a journey and the wayfarer and those whom your right hands possess surely Allah does not love him who is proud boastful
Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly and hide what Allah has given them out of His grace and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement
And those who spend their property in alms to be seen of the people and do not believe in Allah nor in the last day and as for him whose associate is the Shaitan an evil associate is he
And what harm would it have done them if they had believed in Allah and the last day and spent benevolently of what Allah had given them
And Allah knows them
Surely Allah does not do injustice to the weight of an atom and if it is a good deed He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward
How will it be then when We bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these
On that day will those who disbelieve and disobey the Apostle desire that the earth were levelled with them and they shall not hide any word from Allah
O you who believe do not go near prayer when you are Intoxicated until you know well what you say nor when you are under an obligation to perform a bath unless you are travelling on the road until you have washed yourselves and if you are sick or on a journey or one of you come from the privy or you have touched the women and you cannot find water betake yourselves to pure earth then wipe your faces and your hands surely Allah is Pardoning Forgiving
Have you not considered those to whom a portion of the Book has been given They buy error and desire that you should go astray from the way
And Allah best knows your enemies and Allah suffices as a Guardian and Allah suffices as a Helper
Of those who are Jews there are those who alter words from their places and say We have heard and we disobey and Hear may you not be made to hear and Raina distorting the word with their tongues and taunting about religion and if they had said instead We have heard and we obey and hearken and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief so they do not believe but a little
O you who have been given the Book believe that which We have revealed verifying what you have before We alter faces then turn them on their backs or curse them as We cursed the violaters of the Sabbath and the command of Allah shall be executed
Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases and whoever associates anything with Allah he devises indeed a great sin
Have you not considered those who attribute purity to themselves
Nay Allah purifies whom He pleases and they shall not be wronged the husk of a date stone
See how they forge the lie against Allah and this is sufficient as a manifest sin
Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book has been given
They believe in idols and false deities and say of those who disbelieve These are better guided in the path than those who believe
Those are they whom Allah has cursed and whomever Allah curses you shall not find any helper for him
Or have they a share in the kingdom
But then they would not give to people even the speck in the date stone
Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His grace
But indeed We have given to Ibrahim s children the Book and the wisdom and We have given them a grand kingdom
So of them is he who believes in him and of them is he who turns away from him and hell is sufficient to burn
As for those who disbelieve in Our communications We shall make them enter fire so oft as their skins are thoroughly burned We will change them for other skins that they may taste the chastisement surely Allah is Mighty Wise
And as for those who believe and do good deeds We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them for ever they shall have therein pure mates and We shall make them enter a dense shade
Surely Allah commands you to make over trusts to their owners and that when you judge between people you judge with justice surely Allah admonishes you with what is excellent surely Allah is Seeing Hearing
O you who believe obey Allah and obey the Apostle and those in authority from among you then if you quarrel about anything refer it to Allah and the Apostle if you believe in Allah and the last day this is better and very good in the end
Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you They desire to summon one another to the judgment of the Shaitan though they were commanded to deny him and the Shaitan desires to lead them astray into a remote error
And when it is said to them Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Apostle you will see the hypocrites turning away from you with utter aversion
But how will it be when misfortune befalls them on account of what their hands have sent before
Then they will come to you swearing by Allah We did not desire anything but good and concord
These are they of whom Allah knows what is in their hearts therefore turn aside from them and admonish them and speak to them effectual words concerning themselves
And We did not send any apostle but that he should be obeyed by Allah s permission and had they when they were unjust to themselves come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Apostle had also asked forgiveness for them they would have found Allah Oftreturning to mercy Merciful
But no by your Lord they do not believe in reality until they make you a judge of that which has become a matter of disagreement among them and then do not find any straitness in their hearts as to what you have decided and submit with entire submission
And if We had prescribed for them Lay down your lives or go forth from your homes they would not have done it except a few of them and if they had done what they were admonished it would have certainly been better for them and best in strengthening them
And then We would certainly have given them from Ourselves a great reward
And We would certainly have guided them in the right path
And whoever obeys Allah and the Apostle these are with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favors from among the prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good and a goodly company are they
This is grace from Allah and sufficient is Allah as the Knower
O you who believe take your precaution then go forth in detachments or go forth in a body
And surely among you is he who would certainly hang back If then a misfortune befalls you he says Surely Allah conferred a benefit on me that I was not present with them
And if grace from Allah come to you he would certainly cry out as if there had not been any friendship between you and him Would that I had been with them then I should have attained a mighty good fortune
Therefore let those fight in the way of Allah who sell this world s life for the hereafter and whoever fights in the way of Allah then be he slain or be he victorious We shall grant him a mighty reward
And what reason have you that you should not fight in the way of Allah and of the weak among the men and the women and the children of those who say Our Lord cause us to go forth from this town whose people are oppressors and give us from Thee a guardian and give us from Thee a helper
Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the Shaitan
Fight therefore against the friends of the Shaitan surely the strategy of the Shaitan is weak
Have you not seen those to whom it was said Withhold your hands and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate but when fighting is prescribed for them lo a party of them fear men as they ought to have feared Allah or even with a greater fear and say Our Lord why hast Thou ordained fighting for us Wherefore didst Thou not grant us a delay to a near end Say The provision of this world is short and the hereafter is better for him who guards against evil and you shall not be wronged the husk of a date stone
Wherever you are death will overtake you though you are in lofty towers and if a benefit comes to them they say This is from Allah and if a misfortune befalls them they say This is from you Say All is from Allah but what is the matter with these people that they do not make approach to understanding what is told them
Whatever benefit comes to you O man it is from Allah and whatever misfortune befalls you it is from yourself and We have sent you O Prophet to mankind as an apostle and Allah is sufficient as a witness
Whoever obeys the Apostle he indeed obeys Allah and whoever turns back so We have not sent you as a keeper over them
And they say Obedience But when they go out from your presence a party of them decide by night upon doing otherwise than what you say and Allah writes down what they decide by night therefore turn aside from them and trust in Allah and Allah is sufficient as a protector
Do they not then meditate on the Quran
And if it were from any other than Allah they would have found in it many a discrepancy
And when there comes to them news of security or fear they spread it abroad and if they had referred it to the Apostle and to those in authority among them those among them who can search out the knowledge of it would have known it and were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy you would have certainly followed the Shaitan save a few
Fight then in Allah s way this is not imposed on you except In relation to yourself and rouse the believers to ardor maybe Allah will restrain the fighting of those who disbelieve and Allah is strongest in prowess and strongest to give an exemplary punishment
Whoever joins himself to another in a good cause shall have a share of it and whoever joins himself to another in an evil cause shall have the responsibility of it and Allah controls all things
And when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a better greeting than it or return it surely Allah takes account of all things
Allah there is no god but He He will most certainly gather you together on the resurrection day there is no doubt in it and who is more true in word than Allah
What is the matter with you then that you have become two parties about the hypocrites while Allah has made them return to unbelief for what they have earned
Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has caused to err And whomsoever Allah causes to err you shall by no means find a way for him
They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved so that you might be all alike therefore take not from among them friends until they fly their homes in Allah s way but if they turn back then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them a friend or a helper
Except those who reach a people between whom and you there is an alliance or who come to you their hearts shrinking from fighting you or fighting their own people and if Allah had pleased He would have given them power over you so that they should have certainly fought you therefore if they withdraw from you and do not fight you and offer you peace then Allah has not given you a way against them
You will find others who desire that they should be safe from you and secure from their own people as often as they are sent back to the mischief they get thrown into it headlong therefore if they do not withdraw from you and do not offer you peace and restrain their hands then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and against these We have given you a clear authority
And it does not behoove a believer to kill a believer except by mistake and whoever kills a believer by mistake he should free a believing slave and bloodmoney should be paid to his people unless they remit it as alms but if he be from a tribe hostile to you and he is a believer the freeing of a believing slave suffices and if he is from a tribe between whom and you there is a convenant the bloodmoney should be paid to his people along with the freeing of a believing slave but he who cannot find a slave should fast for two months successively a penance from Allah and Allah is Knowing Wise
And whoever kills a believer intentionally his punishment is hell he shall abide in it and Allah will send His wrath on him and curse him and prepare for him a painful chastisement
O you who believe when you go to war in Allah s way make investigation and do not say to any one who offers you peace You are not a believer Do you seek goods of this world s life But with Allah there are abundant gains you too were such before then Allah conferred a benefit on you therefore make investigation surely Allah is aware of what you do
The holders back from among the believers not having any injury and those who strive hard in Allah s way with their property and their persons are not equal Allah has made the strivers with their property and their persons to excel the holders back a high degree and to each class Allah has promised good and Allah shall grant to the strivers above the holders back a mighty reward
High degrees from Him and protection and mercy and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Surely as for those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to their souls they shall say In what state were you
They shall say We were weak in the earth
They shall say Was not Allah s earth spacious so that you should have migrated therein
So these it is whose abode is hell and it is an evil resort
Except the weak from among the men and the children who have not in their power the means nor can they find a way to escape
So these it may be Allah will pardon them and Allah is Pardoning Forgiving
And whoever flies in Allah s way he will find in the earth many a place of refuge and abundant resources and whoever goes forth from his house flying to Allah and His Apostle and then death overtakes him his reward is indeed with Allah and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And when you journey in the earth there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve will cause you distress surely the unbelievers are your open enemy
And when you are among them and keep up the prayer for them let a party of them stand up with you and let them take their arms then when they have prostrated themselves let them go to your rear and let another party who have not prayed come forward and pray with you and let them take their precautions and their arms for those who disbelieve desire that you may be careless of your arms and your luggage so that they may then turn upon you with a sudden united attack and there is no blame on you if you are annoyed with rain or if you are sick that you lay down your arms and take your precautions surely Allah has prepared a disgraceful chastisement for the unbelievers
Then when you have finished the prayer remember Allah standing and sitting and reclining but when you are secure from danger keep up prayer surely prayer is a timed ordinance for the believers
And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain as you suffer pain and you hope from Allah what they do not hope and Allah is Knowing Wise
Surely We have revealed the Book to you with the truth that you may judge between people by means of that which Allah has taught you and be not an advocate on behalf of the treacherous
And ask forgiveness of Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And do not plead on behalf of those who act unfaithfully to their souls surely Allah does not love him who is treacherous sinful
They hide themselves from men and do not hide themselves from Allah and He is with them when they meditate by night words which please Him not and Allah encompasses what they do
Behold you are they who may plead for them in this world s life but who will plead for them with Allah on the resurrection day or who shall be their protector
And whoever does evil or acts unjustly to his soul then asks forgiveness of Allah he shall find Allah Forgiving Merciful
And whoever commits a sin he only commits it against his own soul and Allah is Knowing Wise
And whoever commits a fault or a sin then accuses of it one innocent he indeed takes upon himself the burden of a calumny and a manifest sin
And were it not for Allah s grace upon you and His mercy a party of them had certainly designed to bring you to perdition and they do not bring aught to perdition but their own souls and they shall not harm you in any way and Allah has revealed to you the Book and the wisdom and He has taught you what you did not know and Allah s grace on you is very great
There is no good in most of their secret counsels except in his who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation between people and whoever does this seeking Allah s pleasure We will give him a mighty reward
And whoever acts hostilely to the Apostle after that guidance has become manifest to him and follows other than the way of the believers We will turn him to that to which he has himself turned and make him enter hell and it is an evil resort
Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him and He forgives what is besides this to whom He pleases and whoever associates anything with Allah he indeed strays off into a remote error
They do not call besides Him on anything but idols and they do not call on anything but a rebellious Shaitan
Allah has cursed him and he said Most certainly I will take of Thy servants an appointed portion
And most certainly I will lead them astray and excite in them vain desires and bid them so that they shall slit the ears of the cattle and most certainly I will bid them so that they shall alter Allah s creation and whoever takes the Shaitan for a guardian rather than Allah he indeed shall suffer a manifest loss
He gives them promises and excites vain desires in them and the Shaitan does not promise them but to deceive
These are they whose abode is hell and they shall not find any refuge from it
And as for those who believe and do good We will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein for ever it is a promise of Allah true indeed and who is truer of word than Allah
This shall not be in accordance with your vain desires nor in accordance with the vain desires of the followers of the Book whoever does evil he shall be requited with it and besides Allah he will find for himself neither a guardian nor a helper
And whoever does good deeds whether male or female and he or she is a believer these shall enter the garden and they shall not be dealt with a jot unjustly
And who has a better religion than he who submits himself entirely to Allah And he is the doer of good to others and follows the faith of Ibrahim the upright one and Allah took Ibrahim as a friend
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and Allah encompasses all things
And they ask you a decision about women Say Allah makes known to you His decision concerning them and that which is recited to you in the Book concerning female orphans whom you do not give what is appointed for them while you desire to marry them and concerning the weak among children and that you should deal towards orphans with equity and whatever good you do Allah surely knows it
And if a woman fears ill usage or desertion on the part of her husband there is no blame on them if they effect a reconciliation between them and reconciliation is better and avarice has been made to be present in the people s minds and if you do good to others and guard against evil then surely Allah is aware of what you do
And you have it not in your power to do justice between wives even though you may wish it but be not disinclined from one with total disinclination so that you leave her as it were in suspense and if you effect a reconciliation and guard against evil then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if they separate Allah will render them both free from want out of His ampleness and Allah is Amplegiving Wise
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and certainly We enjoined those who were given the Book before you and We enjoin you too that you should be careful of your duty to Allah and if you disbelieve then surely whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and Allah is Selfsufficient Praiseworthy
And whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and Allah is sufficient as a Protector
If He please He can make you pass away O people and bring others and Allah has the power to do this
Whoever desires the reward of this world then with Allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter and Allah is Hearing Seeing
O you who believe be maintainers of justice bearers of witness of Allah s sake though it may be against your own selves or your parents or near relatives if he be rich or poor Allah is nearer to them both in compassion therefore do not follow your low desires lest you deviate and if you swerve or turn aside then surely Allah is aware of what you do
O you who believe believe in Allah and His Apostle and the Book which He has revealed to His Apostle and the Book which He revealed before and whoever disbelieves in Allah and His angels and His apostles and the last day he indeed strays off into a remote error
Surely as for those who believe then disbelieve again believe and again disbelieve then increase in disbelief Allah will not forgive them nor guide them in the right path
Announce to the hypocrites that they shall have a painful chastisement
Those who take the unbelievers for guardians rather than believers
Do they seek honor from them
Then surely all honor is for Allah
And indeed He has revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah s communications disbelieved in and mocked at do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse surely then you would be like them surely Allah will gather together the hypocrites and the unbelievers all in hell
Those who wait for some misfortune to befall you then If you have a victory from Allah they say Were we not with you
And if there is a chance for the unbelievers they say Did we not acquire the mastery over you and defend you from the believers
So Allah shall Judge between you on the day of resurrection and Allah will by no means give the unbelievers a way against the believers
Surely the hypocrites strive to deceive Allah and He shall requite their deceit to them and when they stand up to prayer they stand up sluggishly they do it only to be seen of men and do not remember Allah save a little
Wavering between that and this belonging neither to these nor to those and whomsoever Allah causes to err you shall not find a way for him
O you who believe do not take the unbelievers for friends rather than the believers do you desire that you should give to Allah a manifest proof against yourselves
Surely the hypocrites are in the lowest stage of the fire and you shall not find a helper for them
Except those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and are sincere in their religion to Allah these are with the believers and Allah will grant the believers a mighty reward
Why should Allah chastise you if you are grateful and believe And Allah is the Multiplier of rewards Knowing
Allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech unless it be by one to whom injustice has been done and Allah is Hearing Knowing
If you do good openly or do it in secret or pardon an evil then surely Allah is Pardoning Powerful
Surely those who disbelieve in Allah and His apostles and those who desire to make a distinction between Allah and His apostles and say We believe in some and disbelieve in others and desire to take a course between this and that
These it is that are truly unbelievers and We have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement
And those who believe in Allah and His apostles and do not make a distinction between any of them Allah will grant them their rewards and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The followers of the Book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven so indeed they demanded of Musa a greater thing than that for they said Show us Allah manifestly so the lightning overtook them on account of their injustice Then they took the calf for a god after clear signs had come to them but We pardoned this and We gave to Musa clear authority
And We lifted the mountain Sainai over them at the taking of the covenant and We said to them Enter the door making obeisance and We said to them Do not exceed the limits of the Sabbath and We made with them a firm covenant
Therefore for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief in the communications of Allah and their killing the prophets wrongfully and their saying Our hearts are covered nay
Allah set a seal upon them owing to their unbelief so they shall not believe except a few
And for their unbelief and for their having uttered against Marium a grievous calumny
And their saying Surely we have killed the Messiah Isa son of Marium the apostle of Allah and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him but it appeared to them so like Isa and most surely those who differ therein are only in a doubt about it they have no knowledge respecting it but only follow a conjecture and they killed him not for sure
Nay
Allah took him up to Himself and Allah is Mighty Wise
And there is not one of the followers of the Book but most certainly believes in this before his death and on the day of resurrection he Isa shall be a witness against them
Wherefore for the iniquity of those who are Jews did We disallow to them the good things which had been made lawful for them and for their hindering many people from Allah s way
And their taking usury though indeed they were forbidden it and their devouring the property of people falsely and We have prepared for the unbelievers from among them a painful chastisement
But the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and those who keep up prayers and those who give the poorrate and the believers in Allah and the last day these it is whom We will give a mighty reward
Surely We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nuh and the prophets after him and We revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes and Isa and Ayub and Yunus and Haroun and Sulaiman and We gave to Dawood
And We sent apostles We have mentioned to you before and apostles we have not mentioned to you and to Musa Allah addressed His Word speaking to him
We sent apostles as the givers of good news and as warners so that people should not have a plea against Allah after the coming of apostles and Allah is Mighty Wise
But Allah bears witness by what He has revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge and the angels bear witness also and Allah is sufficient as a witness
Surely as for those who disbelieve and hinder men from Allah s way they indeed have strayed off into a remote
Surely as for those who disbelieve and act unjustly Allah will not forgive them nor guide them to a path
Except the path of hell to abide in it for ever and this is easy to Allah
O people surely the Apostle has come to you with the truth from your Lord therefore believe it shall be good for you and If you disbelieve then surely whatever is in the heavens and the earth is Allah s and Allah is Knowing Wise
O followers of the Book do not exceed the limits in your religion and do not speak lies against Allah but speak the truth the Messiah Isa son of Marium is only an apostle of Allah and His Word which He communicated to Marium and a spirit from Him believe therefore in Allah and His apostles and say not Three Desist it is better for you Allah is only one Allah far be It from His glory that He should have a son whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His and Allah is sufficient for a Protector
The Messiah does by no means disdain that he should be a servant of Allah nor do the angels who are near to Him and whoever disdains His service and is proud He will gather them all together to Himself
Then as for those who believe and do good He will pay them fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace and as for those who disdain and are proud He will chastise them with a painful chastisement
And they shall not find for themselves besides Allah a guardian or a helper
O people surely there has come to you manifest proof from your Lord and We have sent to you clear light
Then as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast by Him He will cause them to enter into His mercy and grace and guide them to Himself on a right path
They ask you for a decision of the law Say Allah gives you a decision concerning the person who has neither parents nor offspring if a man dies and he has no son and he has a sister she shall have half of what he leaves and he shall be her heir she has no son but if there be two sisters they shall have twothirds of what he leaves and if there are brethren men and women then the male shall have the like of the portion of two females Allah makes clear to you lest you err and Allah knows all things
O you who believe fulfill the obligations
The cattle quadrupeds are allowed to you except that which is recited to you not violating the prohibition against game when you are entering upon the performance of the pilgrimage surely Allah orders what He desires
O you who believe do not violate the signs appointed by Allah nor the sacred month nor interfere with the offerings nor the sacrificial animals with garlands nor those going to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord and when you are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage then hunt and let not hatred of a people because they hindered you from the Sacred Masjid incite you to exceed the limits and help one another in goodness and piety and do not help one another in sin and aggression and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is severe in requiting evil
Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked and the strangled animal and that beaten to death and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn and that which wild beasts have eaten except what you slaughter and what is sacrificed on stones set up for idols and that you divide by the arrows that is a transgression This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion so fear them not and fear Me This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion but whoever is compelled by hunger not inclining willfully to sin then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
They ask you as to what is allowed to them Say The good things are allowed to you and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey training them to hunt you teach them of what Allah has taught you so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of Allah over it and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is swift in reckoning
This day all the good things are allowed to you and the food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them and the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the Book before you are lawful for you when you have given them their dowries taking them in marriage not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret and whoever denies faith his work indeed is of no account and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers
O you who believe when you rise up to prayer wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution then wash yourselves and if you are sick or on a journey or one of you come from the privy or you have touched the women and you cannot find water betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith Allah does not desire to put on you any difficulty but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on you so that you may be grateful
And remember the favor of Allah on you and His covenant with which He bound you firmly when you said We have heard and we obey and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah knows what is in the breasts
O you who believe Be upright for Allah bearers of witness with justice and let not hatred of a people incite you not to act equitably act equitably that is nearer to piety and he careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is Aware of what you do
Allah has promised to those who believe and do good deeds that they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward
And as for those who disbelieve and reject our communications these are the companions of the name
O you who believe remember Allah s favor on you when a people had determined to stretch forth their hands towards you but He withheld their hands from you and be careful of your duty to Allah and on Allah let the believers rely
And certainly Allah made a covenant with the children of Israel and We raised up among them twelve chieftains and Allah said Surely I am with you if you keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and believe in My apostles and assist them and offer to Allah a goodly gift I will most certainly cover your evil deeds and I will most certainly cause you to enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow but whoever disbelieves from among you after that he indeed shall lose the right way
But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard they altered the words from their places and they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of and you shall always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them so pardon them and turn away surely Allah loves those who do good to others
And with those who say We are Christians We made a covenant but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection and Allah will inform them of what they did
O followers of the Book indeed Our Apostle has come to you making clear to you much of what you concealed of the Book and passing over much indeed there has come to you light and a clear Book from Allah
With it Allah guides him who will follow His pleasure into the ways of safety and brings them out of utter darkness into light by His will and guides them to the right path
Certainly they disbelieve who say Surely Allah He is the Messiah son of Marium
Say Who then could control anything as against Allah when He wished to destroy the Messiah son of Marium and his mother and all those on the earth
And Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them He creates what He pleases and Allah has power over all things
And the Jews and the Christians say We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones
Say Why does He then chastise you for your faults
Nay you are mortals from among those whom He has created He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He pleases and Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them and to Him is the eventual coming
O followers of the Book indeed Our Apostle has come to you explaining to you after a cessation of the mission of the apostles lest you say There came not to us a giver of good news or a warner so indeed there has come to you a giver of good news and a warner and Allah has power over all things
And when Musa said to his people O my people remember the favor of Allah upon you when He raised prophets among you and made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the nations
O my people enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed for you and turn not on your backs for then you will turn back losers
They said O Musa surely there is a strong race in it and we will on no account enter it until they go out from it so if they go out from it then surely we will enter
Two men of those who feared upon both of whom Allah had bestowed a favor said Enter upon them by the gate for when you have entered it you shall surely be victorious and on Allah should you rely if you are believers
They said O Musa we shall never enter it so long as they are in it go therefore you and your Lord then fight you both surely we will here sit down
He said My Lord
Surely I have no control upon any but my own self and my brother therefore make a separation between us and the nation of transgressors
He said So it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty years they shall wander about in the land therefore do not grieve for the nation of transgressors
And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with truth when they both offered an offering but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other
He said I will most certainly slay you
The other said Allah only accepts from those who guard against evil
If you will stretch forth your hand towards me to slay me I am not one to stretch forth my hand towards you to slay you surely I fear Allah the Lord of the worlds
Surely I wish that you should bear the sin committed against me and your own sin and so you would be of the inmates of the fire and this is the recompense of the unjust
Then his mind facilitated to him the slaying of his brother so he slew him then he became one of the losers
Then Allah sent a crow digging up the earth so that he might show him how he should cover the dead body of his brother
He said Woe me do I lack the strength that I should be like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother
So he became of those who regret
For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land it is as though he slew all men and whoever keeps it alive it is as though he kept alive all men and certainly Our apostles came to them with clear arguments but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land
The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement
Except those who repent before you have them in your power so know that Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah and seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful
Surely as for those who disbelieve even if they had what is in the earth all of it and the like of it with it that they might ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection it shall not be accepted from them and they shall have a painful punishment
They would desire to go forth from the fire and they shall not go forth from it and they shall have a lasting punishment
And as for the man who steals and the woman who steals cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have earned an exemplary punishment from Allah and Allah is Mighty Wise
But whoever repents after his iniquity and reforms himself then surely Allah will turn to him mercifully surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Do you not know that Allah His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He chastises whom He pleases and forgives whom He pleases and Allah has power over all things
O Apostle let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths We believe and their hearts do not believe and from among those who are Jews they are listeners for the sake of a lie listeners for another people who have not come to you they alter the words from their places saying If you are given this take it and if you are not given this be cautious and as for him whose temptation Allah desires you cannot control anything for him with Allah Those are they for whom Allah does not desire that He should purify their hearts they shall have disgrace in this world and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter
They are listeners of a lie devourers of what is forbidden therefore if they come to you judge between them or turn aside from them and if you turn aside from them they shall not harm you in any way and if you judge judge between them with equity surely Allah loves those who judge equitably
And how do they make you a judge and they have the Taurat wherein is Allah s judgment
Yet they turn back after that and these are not the believers
Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and light with it the prophets who submitted themselves to Allah judged matters for those who were Jews and the masters of Divine knowledge and the doctors because they were required to guard part of the Book of Allah and they were witnesses thereof therefore fear not the people and fear Me and do not take a small price for My communications and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed those are they that are the unbelievers
And We prescribed to them in it that life is for life and eye for eye and nose for nose and ear for ear and tooth for tooth and that there is reprisal in wounds but he who foregoes it it shall be an expiation for him and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed those are they that are the unjust
And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa son of Marium verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light and verifying what was before it of Taurat and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard against evil
And the followers of the Injeel should have judged by what Allah revealed in it and whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed those are they that are the transgressors
And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it therefore judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their low desires to turn away from the truth that has come to you for every one of you did We appoint a law and a way and if Allah had pleased He would have made you all a single people but that He might try you in what He gave you therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous deeds to Allah is your return of all of you so He will let you know that in which you differed
And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their low desires and be cautious of them lest they seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you but if they turn back then know that Allah desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults and most surely many of the people are transgressors
Is it then the judgment of the times of ignorance that they desire
And who is better than Allah to judge for a people who are sure
O you who believe do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends they are friends of each other and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend then surely he is one of them surely Allah does not guide the unjust people
But you will see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening towards them saying We fear lest a calamity should befall us but it may be that Allah will bring the victory or a punishment from Himself so that they shall be regretting on account of what they hid in their souls
And those who believe will say Are these they who swore by Allah with the most forcible of their oaths that they were most surely with you
Their deeds shall go for nothing so they shall become losers
O you who believe whoever from among you turns back from his religion then Allah will bring a people He shall love them and they shall love Him lowly before the believers mighty against the unbelievers they shall strive hard in Allah s way and shall not fear the censure of any censurer this is Allah s Face He gives it to whom He pleases and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
Only Allah is your Vali and His Apostle and those who believe those who keep up prayers and pay the poorrate while they bow
And whoever takes Allah and His apostle and those who believe for a guardian then surely the party of Allah are they that shall be triumphant
O you who believe do not take for guardians those who take your religion for a mockery and a joke from among those who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers and be careful of your duty to Allah if you are believers
And when you call to prayer they make it a mockery and a joke this is because they are a people who do not understand
Say O followers of the Book do you find fault with us for aught except that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before and that most of you are transgressors
Say Shall I inform you of him who is worse than this in retribution from Allah
Worse is he whom Allah has cursed and brought His wrath upon and of whom He made apes and swine and he who served the Shaitan these are worse in place and more erring from the straight path
And when they come to you they say We believe and indeed they come in with unbelief and indeed they go forth with it and Allah knows best what they concealed
And you will see many of them striving with one another to hasten in sin and exceeding the limits and their eating of what is unlawfully acquired certainly evil is that which they do
Why do not the learned men and the doctors of law prohibit them from their speaking of what is sinful and their eating of what is unlawfully acquired
Certainly evil is that which they work
And the Jews say The hand of Allah is tied up Their hands shall be shackled and they shall be cursed for what they say Nay both His hands are spread out He expends as He pleases and what has been revealed to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief and We have put enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection whenever they kindle a fire for war Allah puts it out and they strive to make mischief in the land and Allah does not love the mischiefmakers
And if the followers of the Book had believed and guarded against evil We would certainly have covered their evil deeds and We would certainly have made them enter gardens of bliss
And if they had kept up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which was revealed to them from their Lord they would certainly have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet there is a party of them keeping to the moderate course and as for most of them evil is that which they do
O Apostle deliver what has been revealed to you from your Lord and if you do it not then you have not delivered His message and Allah will protect you from the people surely Allah will not guide the unbelieving people
Say O followers of the Book you follow no good till you keep up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which is revealed to you from your Lord and surely that which has been revealed to you from your Lord shall make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief grieve not therefore for the unbelieving people
Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the Christians whoever believes in Allah and the last day and does good they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Certainly We made a covenant with the children of Israel and We sent to them apostles whenever there came to them an apostle with what that their souls did not desire some of them did they call liars and some they slew
And they thought that there would be no affliction so they became blind and deaf then Allah turned to them mercifully but many of them became blind and deaf and Allah is well seeing what they do
Certainly they disbelieve who say Surely Allah He is the Messiah son of Marium and the Messiah said O Children of Israel serve Allah my Lord and your Lord Surely whoever associates others with Allah then Allah has forbidden to him the garden and his abode is the fire and there shall be no helpers for the unjust
Certainly they disbelieve who say Surely Allah is the third person of the three and there is no god but the one Allah and if they desist not from what they say a painful chastisement shall befall those among them who disbelieve
Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness
And Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The Messiah son of Marium is but an apostle apostles before him have indeed passed away and his mother was a truthful woman they both used to eat food See how We make the communications clear to them then behold how they are turned away
Say Do you serve besides Allah that which does not control for you any harm or any profit
And Allah He is the Hearing the Knowing
Say O followers of the Book be not unduly immoderate in your religion and do not follow the low desires of people who went astray before and led many astray and went astray from the right path
Those who disbelieved from among the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Dawood and Isa son of Marium this was because they disobeyed and used to exceed the limit
They used not to forbid each other the hateful things which they did certainly evil was that which they did
You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve certainly evil is that which their souls have sent before for them that Allah became displeased with them and in chastisement shall they abide
And had they believed in Allah and the prophet and what was revealed to him they would not have taken them for friends but most of them are transgressors
Certainly you will find the most violent of people in enmity for those who believe to be the Jews and those who are polytheists and you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe to be those who say We are Christians this is because there are priests and monks among them and because they do not behave proudly
And when they hear what has been revealed to the apostle you will see their eyes overflowing with tears on account of the truth that they recognize they say Our Lord we believe so write us down with the witnesses of truth
And what reason have we that we should not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us while we earnestly desire that our Lord should cause us to enter with the good people
Therefore Allah rewarded them on account of what they said with gardens in which rivers flow to abide in them and this is the reward of those who do good to others
And as for those who disbelieve and reject Our communications these are the companions of the flame
O you who believe do not forbid yourselves the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits surely Allah does not love those who exceed the limits
And eat of the lawful and good things that Allah has given you and be careful of your duty to Allah in Whom you believe
Allah does not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths but He calls you to account for the making of deliberate oaths so its expiation is the feeding of ten poor men out of the middling food you feed your families with or their clothing or the freeing of a neck but whosoever cannot find means then fasting for three days this is the expiation of your oaths when you swear and guard your oaths Thus does Allah make clear to you His communications that you may be Fateful
O you who believe intoxicants and games of chance and sacrificing to stones set up and dividing by arrows are only an uncleanness the Shaitan s work shun it therefore that you may be successful
The Shaitan only desires to cause enmity and hatred to spring in your midst by means of intoxicants and games of chance and to keep you off from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer
Will you then desist
And obey Allah and obey the apostle and be cautious but if you turn back then know that only a clear deliverance of the message is incumbent on Our apostle
On those who believe and do good there is no blame for what they eat when they are careful of their duty and believe and do good deeds then they are careful of their duty and believe then they are careful of their duty and do good to others and Allah loves those who do good to others
O you who believe
Allah will certainly try you in respect of some game which your hands and your lances can reach that Allah might know who fears Him in secret but whoever exceeds the limit after this he shall have a painful punishment
O you who believe do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage and whoever among you shall kill it intentionally the compensation of it is the like of what he killed from the cattle as two just persons among you shall judge as an offering to be brought to the Kaaba or the expiation of it is the feeding of the poor or the equivalent of it in fasting that he may taste the unwholesome result of his deed Allah has pardoned what is gone by and whoever returns to it Allah will inflict retribution on him and Allah is Mighty Lord of Retribution
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and its food a provision for you and for the travellers and the game of the land is forbidden to you so long as you are on pilgrimage and be careful of your duty to Allah to Whom you shall be gathered
Allah has made the Kaaba the sacred house a maintenance for the people and the sacred month and the offerings and the sacrificial animals with garlands this is that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and that Allah is the Knower of all things
Know that Allah is severe in requiting evil and that Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Nothing is incumbent on the Apostle but to deliver the message and Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide
Say The bad and the good are not equal though the abundance of the bad may please you so be careful of your duty to Allah O men of understanding that you may be successful
O you who believe do not put questions about things which if declared to you may trouble you and if you question about them when the Quran is being revealed they shall be declared to you Allah pardons this and Allah is Forgiving Forbearing
A people before you indeed asked such questions and then became disbelievers on account of them
Allah has not ordained the making of a bahirah or a saibah or a wasilah or a hami but those who disbelieve fabricate a lie against Allah and most of them do not understand
And when it is said to them Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Apostle they say That on which we found our fathers is sufficient for us
What even though their fathers knew nothing and did not follow the right way
O you who believe take care of your souls he who errs cannot hurt you when you are on the right way to Allah is your return of all of you so He will inform you of what you did
O you who believe call to witness between you when death draws nigh to one of you at the time of making the will two just persons from among you or two others from among others than you if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of death befalls you the two witnesses you should detain after the prayer then if you doubt them they shall both swear by Allah saying We will not take for it a price though there be a relative and we will not hide the testimony of Allah for then certainly we should be among the sinners
Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them the two nearest in kin so they two should swear by Allah Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two and we have not exceeded the limit for then most surely we should be of the unjust
This is more proper in order that they should give testimony truly or fear that other oaths be given after their oaths and be careful of your duty to Allah and hear and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
On the day when Allah will assemble the apostles then say What answer were you given
They shall say We have no knowledge surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things
When Allah will say O Isa son of Marium Remember My favor on you and on your mother when I strengthened you I with the holy Spirit you spoke to the people in the cradle and I when of old age and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Taurat and the Injeel and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission and when you brought forth the dead by My permission and when I withheld the children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments but those who disbelieved among them said This is nothing but clear enchantment
And when I revealed to the disciples saying Believe in Me and My apostle they said We believe and bear witness that we submit ourselves
When the disciples said O Isa son of Marium will your Lord consent to send down to us food from heaven
He said Be careful of your duty to Allah if you are believers
They said We desire that we should eat of it and that our hearts should be at rest and that we may know that you have indeed spoken the truth to us and that we may be of the witnesses to it
Isa the son of Marium said O Allah our Lord send down to us food from heaven which should be to us an everrecurring happiness to the first of us and to the last of us and a sign from Thee and grant us means of subsistence and Thou art the best of the Providers
Allah said Surely I will send it down to you but whoever shall disbelieve afterwards from among you surely I will chastise him with a chastisement with which I will not chastise anyone among the nations
And when Allah will say O Isa son of Marium did you say to men Take me and my mother for two gods besides Allah he will say Glory be to Thee it did not befit me that I should say what I had no right to say if I had said it Thou wouldst indeed have known it Thou knowest what is in my mind and I do not know what is in Thy mind surely Thou art the great Knower of the unseen things
I did not say to them aught save what Thou didst enjoin me with That serve Allah my Lord and your Lord and I was a witness of them so long as I was among them but when Thou didst cause me to die Thou wert the watcher over them and Thou art witness of all things
If Thou shouldst chastise them then surely they are Thy servants and if Thou shouldst forgive them then surely Thou art the Mighty the Wise
Allah will say This is the day when their truth shall benefit the truthful ones they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them for ever Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Allah this is the mighty achievement
Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is in them and He has power over all things
All praise is due to Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light yet those who disbelieve set up equals with their Lord
He it is Who created you from clay then He decreed a term and there is a term named with Him still you doubt
And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth He knows your secret thoughts and your open words and He knows what you earn
And there does not come to them any communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it
So they have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them therefore the truth of what they mocked at will shine upon them
Do they not consider how many a generation We have destroyed before them whom We had established in the earth as We have not established you and We sent the clouds pouring rain on them in abundance and We made the rivers to flow beneath them then We destroyed them on account of their faults and raised up after them another generation
And if We had sent to you a writing on a paper then they had touched it with their hands certainly those who disbelieve would have said This is nothing but clear enchantment
And they say Why has not an angel been sent down to him
And had We sent down an angel the matter would have certainly been decided and then they would not have been respited
And if We had made him angel We would certainly have made him a man and We would certainly have made confused to them what they make confused
And certainly apostles before you were mocked at but that which they mocked at encompassed the scoffers among them
Say Travel in the land then see what was the end of the rejecters
Say To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth
Say To Allah He has ordained mercy on Himself most certainly He will gather you on the resurrection day there is no doubt about it
As for those who have lost their souls they will not believe
And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day and He is the Hearing the Knowing
Say Shall I take a guardian besides Allah the Originator of the heavens and the earth and He feeds others and is not Himself fed
Say I am commanded to be the first who submits himself and you should not be of the polytheists
Say Surely I fear if I disobey my Lord the chastisement of a grievous day
He from whom it is averted on that day Allah indeed has shown mercy to him and this is a manifest achievement
And if Allah touch you with affliction there is none to take it off but He and if He visit you with good then He has power over all things
And He is the Supreme above His servants and He is the Wise the Aware
Say What thing is the weightiest in testimony
Say Allah is witness between you and me and this Quran has been revealed to me that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches
Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah
Say I do not bear witness
Say He is only one Allah and surely I am clear of that which you set up with Him
Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons as for those who have lost their souls they will not believe
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or he who gives the lie to His communications surely the unjust will not be successful
And on the day when We shall gather them all together then shall We say to those who associated others with Allah Where are your associates whom you asserted
Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say By Allah our Lord we were not polytheists
See how they lie against their own souls and that which they forged has passed away from them
And of them is he who hearkens to you and We have cast veils over their hearts lest they understand it and a heaviness into their ears and even if they see every sign they will not believe in it so much so that when they come to you they only dispute with you those who disbelieve say This is naught but the stories of the ancients
And they prohibit others from it and go far away from it and they only bring destruction upon their own souls while they do not perceive
And could you see when they are made to stand before the fire then they shall say Would that we were sent back and we would not reject the communications of our Lord and we would be of the believers
Nay what they concealed before shall become manifest to them and if they were sent back they would certainly go back to that which they are forbidden and most surely they are liars
And they say There is nothing but our life of this world and we shall not be raised
And could you see when they are made to stand before their Lord
He will say Is not this the truth
They will say Yea by our Lord
He will say Taste then the chastisement because you disbelieved
They are losers indeed who reject the meeting of Allah until when the hour comes upon them all of a sudden they shall say O our grief for our neglecting it and they shall bear their burdens on their backs now surely evil is that which they bear
And this world s life is naught but a play and an idle sport and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard against evil do you not then understand
We know indeed that what they say certainly grieves you but surely they do not call you a liar but the unjust deny the communications of Allah
And certainly apostles before you were rejected but they were patient on being rejected and persecuted until Our help came to them and there is none to change the words of Allah and certainly there has come to you some information about the apostles
And if their turning away is hard on you then if you can seek an opening to go down into the earth or a ladder to ascend up to heaven so that you should bring them a sign and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have gathered them all on guidance therefore be not of the ignorant
Only those accept who listen and as to the dead Allah will raise them then to Him they shall be returned
And they say Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord
Say Surely Allah is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know
And there is no animal that walks upon the earth nor a bird that flies with its two wings but they are genera like yourselves We have not neglected anything in the Book then to their Lord shall they be gathered
And they who reject Our communications are deaf and dumb in utter darkness whom Allah pleases He causes to err and whom He pleases He puts on the right way
Say Tell me if the chastisement of Allah should overtake you or the hour should come upon you will you call on others besides Allah if you are truthful
Nay Him you call upon so He clears away that for which you pray if He pleases and you forget what you set up with Him
And certainly We sent apostles to nations before you then We seized them with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves
Yet why did they not when Our punishment came to them humble themselves
But their hearts hardened and the Shaitan made what they did fairseeming to them
But when they neglected that with which they had been admonished We opened for them the doors of all things until when they rejoiced in what they were given We seized them suddenly then lo they were in utter despair
So the roots of the people who were unjust were cut off and all praise is due to Allah the Lord of the worlds
Say Have you considered that if Allah takes away your hearing and your sight and sets a seal on your hearts who is the god besides Allah that can bring it to you
See how We repeat the communications yet they turn away
Say Have you considered if the chastisement of Allah should overtake you suddenly or openly will any be destroyed but the unjust people
And We send not apostles but as announcers of good news and givers of warning then whoever believes and acts aright they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
And as for those who reject Our communications chastisement shall afflict them because they transgressed
Say I do not say to you I have with me the treasures of Allah nor do I know the unseen nor do I say to you that I am an angel I do not follow aught save that which is revealed to me
Say Are the blind and the seeing one alike
Do you not then reflect
And warn with it those who fear that they shall be gathered to their Lord there is no guardian for them nor any intercessor besides Him that they may guard against evil
And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening they desire only His favor neither are you answerable for any reckoning of theirs nor are they answerable for any reckoning of yours so that you should drive them away and thus be of the unjust
And thus do We try some of them by others so that they say Are these they upon whom Allah has conferred benefit from among us
Does not Allah best know the grateful
And when those who believe in Our communications come to you say Peace be on you your Lord has ordained mercy on Himself so that if any one of you does evil in ignorance then turns after that and acts aright then He is Forgiving Merciful
And thus do We make distinct the communications and so that the way of the guilty may become clear
Say I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah
Say I do not follow your low desires for then indeed I should have gone astray and I should not be of those who go aright
Say Surely I have manifest proof from my Lord and you call it a lie I have not with me that which you would hasten the judgment is only Allah s He relates the truth and He is the best of deciders
Say If that which you desire to hasten were with me the matter would have certainly been decided between you and me and Allah best knows the unjust
And with Him are the keys of the unseen treasures none knows them but He and He knows what is in the land and the sea and there falls not a leaf but He knows it nor a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything green nor dry but it is all in a clear book
And He it is Who takes your souls at night in sleep and He knows what you acquire in the day then He raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled then to Him is your return then He will inform you of what you were doing
And He is the Supreme above His servants and He sends keepers over you until when death comes to one of you Our apostles cause him to die and they are not remiss
Then are they sent back to Allah their Master the True one now surely His is the judgment and He is swiftest in taking account
Say Who is it that delivers you from the dangers of the land and the sea when you call upon Him openly humiliating yourselves and in secret If He delivers us from this we should certainly be of the grateful ones
Say Allah delivers you from them and from every distress but again you set up others with Him
Say He has the power that He should send on you a chastisement from above you or from beneath your feet or that He should throw you into confusion making you of different parties and make some of you taste the fighting of others
See how We repeat the communications that they may understand
And your people call it a lie and it is the very truth
Say I am not placed in charge of you
For every prophecy is a term and you will come to know it
And when you see those who enter into false discourses about Our communications withdraw from them until they enter into some other discourse and if the Shaitan causes you to forget then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people
And nought of the reckoning of their deeds shall be against those who guard against evil but theirs is only to remind haply they may guard
And leave those who have taken their religion for a play and an idle sport and whom this world s life has deceived and remind them thereby lest a soul should be given up to destruction for what it has earned it shall not have besides Allah any guardian nor an intercessor and if it should seek to give every compensation it shall not be accepted from it these are they who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned they shall have a drink of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved
Say Shall we call on that besides Allah which does not benefit us nor harm us and shall we be returned back on our heels after Allah has guided us like him whom the Shaitans have made to fall down perplexed in the earth
He has companions who call him to the right way saying Come to us
Say Surely the guidance of Allah that is the true guidance and we are commanded that we should submit to the Lord of the worlds
And that you should keep up prayer and be careful of your duty to Him and He it is to Whom you shall be gathered
And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth with truth and on the day He says Be it is His word is the truth and His is the kingdom on the day when the trumpet shall be blown the Knower of the unseen and the seen and He is the Wise the Aware
And when Ibrahim said to his sire Azar Do you take idols for gods
Surely I see you and your people in manifest error
And thus did We show Ibrahim the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that he might be of those who are sure
So when the night overshadowed him he saw a star said he Is this my Lord
So when it set he said I do not love the setting ones
Then when he saw the moon rising he said Is this my Lord
So when it set he said If my Lord had not guided me I should certainly be of the erring people
Then when he saw the sun rising he said Is this my Lord
Is this the greatest So when it set he said O my people surely I am clear of what you set up with Allah
Surely I have turned myself being upright wholly to Him Who originated the heavens and the earth and I am not of the polytheists
And his people disputed with him
He said Do you dispute with me respecting Allah
And He has guided me indeed and I do not fear in any way those that you set up with Him unless my Lord pleases my Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge will you not then mind
And how should I fear what you have set up with Him while you do not fear that you have set up with Allah that for which He has not sent down to you any authority which then of the two parties is surer of security if you know
Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with iniquity those are they who shall have the security and they are those who go aright
And this was Our argument which we gave to Ibrahim against his people We exalt in dignity whom We please surely your Lord is Wise Knowing
And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub each did We guide and Nuh did We guide before and of his descendants Dawood and Sulaiman and Ayub and Yusuf and Musa and Haroun and thus do We reward those who do good to others
And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas every one was of the good
And Ismail and AlYasha and Yunus and Lut and every one We made to excel in the worlds
And from among their fathers and their descendants and their brethren and We chose them and guided them into the right way
This is Allah s guidance He guides thereby whom He pleases of His servants and if they had set up others with Him certainly what they did would have become ineffectual for them
These are they to whom We gave the book and the wisdom and the prophecy therefore if these disbelieve in it We have already entrusted with it a people who are not disbelievers in it
These are they whom Allah guided therefore follow their guidance
Say I do not ask you for any reward for it it is nothing but a reminder to the nations
And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him when they say Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal
Say Who revealed the Book which Musa brought a light and a guidance to men which you make into scattered writings which you show while you conceal much
And you were taught what you did not know neither you nor your fathers
Say Allah then leave them sporting in their vain discourses
And this is a Book We have revealed blessed verifying that which is before it and that you may warn the metropolis and those around her and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they attend to their prayers constantly
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or says It has been revealed to me while nothing has been revealed to him and he who says I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed and if you had seen when the unjust shall be in the agonies of death and the angels shall spread forth their hands Give up your souls today shall you be recompensed with an ignominious chastisement because you spoke against Allah other than the truth and because you showed pride against His communications
And certainly you have come to Us alone as We created you at first and you have left behind your backs the things which We gave you and We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were Allah s associates in respect to you certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted is gone from you
Surely Allah causes the grain and the stone to germinate He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer forth of the dead from the living that is Allah how are you then turned away
He causes the dawn to break and He has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning this is an arrangement of the Mighty the Knowing
And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you might follow the right way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea truly We have made plain the communications for a people who know
And He it is Who has brought you into being from a single soul then there is for you a restingplace and a depository indeed We have made plain the communications for a people who understand
And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud then We bring forth with it buds of all plants then We bring forth from it green foliage from which We produce grain piled up in the ear and of the palmtree of the sheaths of it come forth clusters of dates within reach and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates alike and unlike behold the fruit of it when it yields the fruit and the ripening of it most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
And they make the jinn associates with Allah while He created them and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without knowledge glory be to Him and highly exalted is He above what they ascribe to Him
Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth
How could He have a son when He has no consort and He Himself created everything and He is the Knower of all things
That is Allah your Lord there is no god but He the Creator of all things therefore serve Him and He has charge of all things
Vision comprehends Him not and He comprehends all vision and He is the Knower of subtleties the Aware
Indeed there have come to you clear proofs from your Lord whoever will therefore see it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind it shall be against himself and I am not a keeper over you
And thus do We repeat the communications and that they may say You have read and that We may make it clear to a people who know
Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord there is no god but He and withdraw from the polytheists
And if Allah had pleased they would not have set up others with Him and We have not appointed you a keeper over them and you are not placed in charge of them
And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah lest exceeding the limits they should abuse Allah out of ignorance Thus have We made fair seeming to every people their deeds then to their Lord shall be their return so He will inform them of what they did
And they swear by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if a sign came to them they would most certainly believe in it
Say Signs are only with Allah and what should make you know that when it comes they will not believe
And We will turn their hearts and their sights even as they did not believe in it the first time and We will leave them in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
And even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead had spoken to them and We had brought together all things before them they would not believe unless Allah pleases but most of them are ignorant
And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy the Shaitans from among men and jinn some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive them and had your Lord pleased they would not have done it therefore leave them and that which they forge
And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they are going to earn of evil
Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah And He it is Who has revealed to you the Book which is made plain and those whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your Lord with truth therefore you should not be of the disputers
And the word of your Lord has been accomplished truly and justly there is none who can change His words and He is the Hearing the Knowing
And if you obey most of those in the earth they will lead you astray from Allah s way they follow but conjecture and they only lie
Surely your Lord He best knows who goes astray from His way and He best knows those who follow the right course
Therefore eat of that on which Allah s name has been mentioned if you are believers in His communications
And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah s name has been mentioned and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you excepting what you are compelled to and most surely many would lead people astray by their low desires out of ignorance surely your Lord He best knows those who exceed the limits
And abandon open and secret sin surely they who earn sin shall be recompensed with what they earned
And do not eat of that on which Allah s name has not been mentioned and that is most surely a transgression and most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should contend with you and if you obey them you shall most surely be polytheists
Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth
Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers
And thus have We made in every town the great ones to be its guilty ones that they may plan therein and they do not plan but against their own souls and they do not perceive
And when a communication comes to them they say We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah s apostles are given
Allah best knows where He places His message
There shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from Allah and severe chastisement because of what they planned
Therefore for whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright He expands his breast for Islam and for whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe
And this is the path of your Lord a right path indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who mind
They shall have the abode of peace with their Lord and He is their guardian because of what they did
And on the day when He shall gather them all together O assembly of jinn you took away a great part of mankind And their friends from among the men shall say Our Lord some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which Thou didst appoint for us He shall say The fire is your abode to abide in it except as Allah is pleased surely your Lord is Wise Knowing
And thus do We make some of the iniquitous to befriend others on account of what they earned
O assembly of jinn and men did there not come to you apostles from among you relating to you My communications and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours They shall say We bear witness against ourselves and this world s life deceived them and they shall bear witness against their own souls that they were unbelievers
This is because your Lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people were negligent
And all have degrees according to what they do and your Lord is not heedless of what they do
And your Lord is the Selfsufficient one the Lord of mercy if He pleases He may take you off and make whom He pleases successors after you even as He raised you up from the seed of another people
Surely what you are threatened with must come to pass and you cannot escape it
Say O my people act according to your ability I too am acting so you will soon come to know for whom of us will be the good end of the abode surely the unjust shall not be successful
And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has created of tilth and cattle and say This is for Allah so they assert and this for our associates then what is for their associates it reaches not to Allah and whatever is set apart for Allah it reaches to their associates evil is that which they judge
And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most of the polytheists the killing of their children that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion and if Allah had pleased they would not have done it therefore leave them and that which they forge
And they say These are cattle and tilth prohibited none shall eat them except such as We please so they assert and cattle whose backs are forbidden and cattle on which they would not mention Allah s name forging a lie against Him He shall requite them for what they forged
And they say What is in the wombs of these cattle is specially for our males and forbidden to our wives and if it be stillborn then they are all partners in it He will reward them for their attributing falsehood to Allah surely He is Wise Knowing
They are lost indeed who kill their children foolishly without knowledge and forbid what Allah has given to them forging a lie against Allah they have indeed gone astray and they are not the followers of the right course
And He it is Who produces gardens of vine trellised and untrellised and palms and seedproduce of which the fruits are of various sorts and olives and pomegranates like and unlike eat of its fruit when it bears fruit and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping and do not act extravagantly surely He does not love the extravagant
And of cattle He created beasts of burden and those which are fit for slaughter only eat of what Allah has given you and do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan surely he is your open enemy
Eight in pairs two of sheep and two of goats
Say Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain
Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful
And two of camels and two of cows
Say Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain
Or were you witnesses when Allah enjoined you this
Who then is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah that he should lead astray men without knowledge
Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people
Say I do not find in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of except that it be what has died of itself or blood poured forth or flesh of swine for that surely is unclean or that which is a transgression other than the name of Allah having been invoked on it but whoever is driven to necessity not desiring nor exceeding the limit then surely your Lord is Forgiving Merciful
And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every animal having claws and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful to them the fat of both except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones this was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion and We are surely Truthful
But if they give you the lie then say Your Lord is the Lord of Allencompassing mercy and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people
Those who are polytheists will say If Allah had pleased we would not have associated aught with Him nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden to ourselves anything even so did those before them reject until they tasted Our punishment
Say Have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it forth to us
You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies
Say Then Allah s is the conclusive argument so if He please He would certainly guide you all
Say Bring your witnesses who should bear witness that Allah has forbidden this then if they bear witness do not bear witness with them and follow not the low desires of those who reject Our communications and of those who do not believe in the hereafter and they make others equal to their Lord
Say Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you remember that you do not associate anything with Him and show kindness to your parents and do not slay your children for fear of poverty We provide for you and for them and do not draw nigh to indecencies those of them which are apparent and those which are concealed and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except for the requirements of justice this He has enjoined you with that you may understand
And do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he attains his maturity and give full measure and weight with justice We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability and when you speak then be just though it be against a relative and fulfill Allah s covenant this He has enjoined you with that you may be mindful
And know that this is My path the right one therefore follow it and follow not other ways for they will lead you away from His way this He has enjoined you with that you may guard against evil
Again We gave the Book to Musa to complete Our blessings on him who would do good to others and making plain all things and a guidance and a mercy so that they should believe in the meeting of their Lord
And this is a Book We have revealed blessed therefore follow it and guard against evil that mercy may be shown to you
Lest you say that the Book was only revealed to two parties before us and We were truly unaware of what they read
Or lest you should say If the Book had been revealed to us we would certainly have been better guided than they so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord and guidance and mercy
Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah s communications and turns away from them
We will reward those who turn away from Our communications with an evil chastisement because they turned away
They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them or that your Lord should come or that some of the signs of your Lord should come
On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before or earn good through its faith
Say Wait we too are waiting
Surely they who divided their religion into parts and became sects you have no concern with them their affair is only with Allah then He will inform them of what they did
Whoever brings a good deed he shall have ten like it and whoever brings an evil deed he shall be recompensed only with the like of it and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Say Surely as for me my Lord has guided me to the right path to a most right religion the faith of Ibrahim the upright one and he was not of the polytheists
Say Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are all for Allah the Lord of the worlds
No associate has He and this am I commanded and I am the first of those who submit
Say What shall I seek a Lord other than Allah And He is the Lord of all things and no soul earns evil but against itself and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another then to your Lord is your return so He will inform you of that in which you differed
And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and raised some of you above others by various grades that He might try you by what He has given you surely your Lord is quick to requite evil and He is most surely the Forgiving the Merciful
Alif Lam Mim Suad
A Book revealed to you so let there be no straitness in your breast on account of it that you may warn thereby and a reminder close to the believers
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow guardians besides Him how little do you mind
And how many a town that We destroyed so Our punishment came to it by night or while they slept at midday
Yet their cry when Our punishment came to them was nothing but that they said Surely we were unjust
Most certainly then We will question those to whom the apostles were sent and most certainly We will also question the apostles
Then most certainly We will relate to them with knowledge and We were not absent
And the measuring out on that day will be just then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy those are they who shall be successful
And as for him whose measure of good deeds is light those are they who have made their souls suffer loss because they disbelieved in Our communications
And certainly We have established you in the earth and made in it means of livelihood for you little it is that you give thanks
And certainly We created you then We fashioned you then We said to the angels Prostrate to Adam
So they did prostrate except Iblis he was not of those who prostrated
He said What hindered you so that you did not prostrate when I commanded you
He said I am better than he Thou hast created me of fire while him Thou didst create of dust
He said Then get forth from this state for it does not befit you to behave proudly therein
Go forth therefore surely you are of the abject ones
He said Respite me until the day when they are raised up
He said Surely you are of the respited ones
He said As Thou hast caused me to remain disappointed I will certainly lie in wait for them in Thy straight path
Then I will certainly come to them from before them and from behind them and from their righthand side and from their lefthand side and Thou shalt not find most of them thankful
He said Get out of this state despised driven away whoever of them will follow you I will certainly fill hell with you all
And We said O Adam
Dwell you and your wife in the garden so eat from where you desire but do not go near this tree for then you will be of the unjust
But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them what had been hidden from them of their evil inclinations and he said Your Lord has not forbidden you this tree except that you may not both become two angels or that you may not become of the immortals
And he swore to them both Most surely I am a sincere adviser to you
Then he caused them to fall by deceit so when they tasted of the tree their evil inclinations became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden and their Lord called out to them Did I not forbid you both from that tree and say to you that the Shaitan is your open enemy
They said Our Lord
We have been unjust to ourselves and if Thou forgive us not and have not mercy on us we shall certainly be of the losers
He said Get forth some of you the enemies of others and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time
He also said Therein shall you live and therein shall you die and from it shall you be raised
O children of Adam
We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame and clothing for beauty and clothing that guards against evil that is the best
This is of the communications of Allah that they may be mindful
O children of Adam let not the Shaitan cause you to fall into affliction as he expelled your parents from the garden pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them their evil inclinations he surely sees you he as well as his host from whence you cannot see them surely We have made the Shaitans to be the guardians of those who do not believe
And when they commit an indecency they say We found our fathers doing this and Allah has enjoined it on us Say Surely Allah does not enjoin indecency do you say against Allah what you do not know
Say My Lord has enjoined justice and set upright your faces at every time of prayer and call on Him being sincere to Him in obedience as He brought you forth in the beginning so shall you also return
A part has He guided aright and as for another part error is justly their due surely they took the Shaitans for guardians beside Allah and they think that they are followers of the right
O children of Adam attend to your embellishments at every time of prayer and eat and drink and be not extravagant surely He does not love the extravagant
Say Who has prohibited the embellishment of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants and the good provisions
Say These are for the believers in the life of this world purely theirs on the resurrection day thus do We make the communications clear for a people who know
Say My Lord has only prohibited indecencies those of them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed and sin and rebellion without justice and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority and that you say against Allah what you do not know
And for every nation there is a doom so when their doom is come they shall not remain behind the least while nor shall they go before
O children of Adam if there come to you apostles from among you relating to you My communications then whoever shall guard against evil and act aright they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
And as for those who reject Our communications and turn away from them haughtily these are the inmates of the fire they shall abide in it
Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or rejects His communications
As for those their portion of the Book shall reach them until when Our apostles come to them causing them to die they shall say Where is that which you used to call upon besides Allah They would say They are gone away from us and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
He will say Enter into fire among the nations that have passed away before you from among jinn and men whenever a nation shall enter it shall curse its sister until when they have all come up with one another into it the last of them shall say with regard to the foremost of them Our Lord these led us astray therefore give them a double chastisement of the fire He will say Every one shall have double but you do not know
And the foremost of them will say to the last of them So you have no preference over us therefore taste the chastisement for what you earned
Surely as for those who reject Our communications and turn away from them haughtily the doors of heaven shall not be opened for them nor shall they enter the garden until the camel pass through the eye of the needle and thus do We reward the guilty
They shall have a bed of hellfire and from above them coverings of it and thus do We reward the unjust
And as for those who believe and do good We do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability they are the dwellers of the garden in it they shall abide
And We will remove whatever of illfeeling is in their breasts the rivers shall flow beneath them and they shall say All praise is due to Allah Who guided us to this and we would not have found the way had it not been that Allah had guided us certainly the apostles of our Lord brought the truth and it shall be cried out to them that this is the garden of which you are made heirs for what you did
And the dwellers of the garden will call out to the inmates of the fire Surely we have found what our Lord promised us to be true have you too found what your Lord promised to be true
They will say Yes
Then a crier will cry out among them that the curse of Allah is on the unjust
Who hinder people from Allah s way and seek to make it crooked and they are disbelievers in the hereafter
And between the two there shall be a veil and on the most elevated places there shall be men who know all by their marks and they shall call out to the dwellers of the garden Peace be on you they shall not have yet entered it though they hope
And when their eyes shall be turned towards the inmates of the fire they shall say Our Lord place us not with the unjust
And the dwellers of the most elevated places shall call out to men whom they will recognize by their marks saying Of no avail were to you your amassings and your behaving haughtily
Are these they about whom you swore that Allah will not bestow mercy on them
Enter the garden you shall have no fear nor shall you grieve
And the inmates of the fire shall call out to the dwellers of the garden saying Pour on us some water or of that which Allah has given you
They shall say Surely Allah has prohibited them both to the unbelievers
Who take their religion for an idle sport and a play and this life s world deceives them so today We forsake them as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs and as they denied Our communications
And certainly We have brought them a Book which We have made clear with knowledge a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
Do they wait for aught but its final sequel
On the day when its final sequel comes about those who neglected it before will say Indeed the apostles of our Lord brought the truth are there for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our behalf
Or could we be sent back so that we should do deeds other than those which we did
Indeed they have lost their souls and that which they forged has gone away from them
Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time and He is firm in power He throws the veil of night over the day which it pursues incessantly and He created the sun and the moon and the stars made subservient by His command surely His is the creation and the command blessed is Allah the Lord of the worlds
Call on your Lord humbly and secretly surely He does not love those who exceed the limits
And do not make mischief in the earth after its reformation and call on Him fearing and hoping surely the mercy of Allah is nigh to those who do good to others
And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news before His mercy until when they bring up a laden cloud We drive it to a dead land then We send down water on it then bring forth with it of fruits of all kinds thus shall We bring forth the dead that you may be mindful
And as for the good land its vegetation springs forth abundantly by the permission of its Lord and as for that which is inferior its herbage comes forth but scantily thus do We repeat the communications for a people who give thanks
Certainly We sent Nuh to his people so he said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than Him surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day
The chiefs of his people said Most surely we see you in clear error
He said O my people there is no error in me but I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I offer you good advice and I know from Allah what you do not know
What do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he might warn you and that you might guard against evil and so that mercy may be shown to you
But they called him a liar so We delivered him and those with him in the ark and We drowned those who rejected Our communications surely they were a blind people
And to Ad We sent their brother Hud He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than Him will you not then guard against evil
The chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said Most surely we see you in folly and most surely we think you to be of the liars
He said O my people there is no folly in me but I am an apostle of the Lord of the worlds
I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful adviser to you
What do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you that he might warn you
And remember when He made you successors after Nuh s people and increased you in excellence in respect of make therefore remember the benefits of Allah that you may be successful
They said Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone and give up what our fathers used to serve
Then bring to us what you threaten us with if you are of the truthful ones
He said Indeed uncleanness and wrath from your Lord have lighted upon you what do you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have given Allah has not sent any authority for them wait then I too with you will be of those who wait
So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us and We cut off the last of those who rejected Our communications and were not believers
And to Samood We sent their brother Salih He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than Him clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord this is as Allah s shecamel for you a sign therefore leave her alone to pasture on Allah s earth and do not touch her with any harm otherwise painful chastisement will overtake you
And remember when He made you successors after Ad and settled you in the land you make mansions on its plains and hew out houses in the mountains remember therefore Allah s benefits and do not act corruptly in the land making mischief
The chief of those who behaved proudly among his people said to those who were considered weak to those who believed from among them Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord
They said Surely we are believers in what he has been sent with
Those who were haughty said Surely we are deniers of what you believe in
So they slew the shecamel and revolted against their Lord s commandment and they said O Salih bring us what you threatened us with if you are one of the apostles
Then the earthquake overtook them so they became motionless bodies in their abode
Then he turned away from them and said O my people I did certainly deliver to you the message of my Lord and I gave you good advice but you do not love those who give good advice
And We sent Lut when he said to his people What do you commit an indecency which any one in the world has not done before you
Most surely you come to males in lust besides females nay you are an extravagant people
And the answer of his people was no other than that they said Turn them out of your town surely they are a people who seek to purify themselves
So We delivered him and his followers except his wife she was of those who remained behind
And We rained upon them a rain consider then what was the end of the guilty
And to Madyan We sent their brother Shu aib He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than Him clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord therefore give full measure and weight and do not diminish to men their things and do not make mischief in the land after its reform this is better for you if you are believers
And do not lie in wait in every path threatening and turning away from Allah s way him who believes in Him and seeking to make it crooked and remember when you were few then He multiplied you and consider what was the end of the mischiefmakers
And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which am sent and another party who do not believe then wait patiently until Allah judges between us and He is the best of the Judges
The chiefs those who were proud from among his people said We will most certainly turn you out O Shu aib and also those who believe with you from our town or you shall come back to our faith
He said What though we dislike it
Indeed we shall have forged a lie against Allah If we go back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from It and it befits us not that we should go back to it except if Allah our Lord please Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge in Allah do we trust Our Lord decide between us and our people with truth and Thou art the best of deciders
And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said If you follow Shu aib you shall then most surely be losers
Then the earthquake overtook them so they became motionless bodies in their abode
Those who called Shu aib a liar were as though they had never dwelt therein those who called Shu aib a liar they were the losers
So he turned away from them and said O my people certainly I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and I gave you good advice how shall I then be sorry for an unbelieving people
And We did not send a prophet in a town but We overtook its people with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves
Then We gave them good in the place of evil until they became many and said Distress and happiness did indeed befall our fathers
Then We took them by surprise while they did not perceive
And if the people of the towns had believed and guarded against evil We would certainly have opened up for them blessings from the heaven and the earth but they rejected so We overtook them for what they had earned
What do the people of the towns then feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep
What do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in the morning while they play
What do they then feel secure from Allah s plan
But none feels secure from Allah s plan except the people who shall perish
Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its former residents that if We please We would afflict them on account of their faults and set a seal on their hearts so they would not hear
These towns We relate to you some of their stories and certainly their apostles came to them with clear arguments but they would not believe in what they rejected at first thus does Allah set a seal over the hearts of the unbelievers
And We did not find in most of them any faithfulness to covenant and We found most of them to be certainly transgressors
Then we raised after them Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs but they disbelieved in them consider then what was the end of the mischief makers
And Musa said O Firon surely I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds
I am worthy of not saying anything about Allah except the truth I have come to you indeed with clear proof from your Lord therefore send with me the children of Israel
He said If you have come with a sign then bring it if you are of the truthful ones
So he threw his rod then lo it was a clear serpent
And he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders
The chiefs of Firon s people said most surely this is an enchanter possessed of knowledge
He intends to turn you out of your land
What counsel do you then give
They said Put him off and his brother and send collectors into the cities
That they may bring to you every enchanter possessed of knowledge
And the enchanters came to Firon and said We must surely have a reward if we are the prevailing ones
He said Yes and you shall certainly be of those who are near to me
They said O Musa will you cast or shall we be the first to cast
He said Cast
So when they cast they deceived the people s eyes and frightened them and they produced a mighty enchantment
And We revealed to Musa saying Cast your rod then lo it devoured the lies they told
So the truth was established and what they did became null
Thus they were vanquished there and they went back abased
And the enchanters were thrown down prostrating themselves
They said We believe in the Lord of the worlds
The Lord of Musa and Haroun
Firon said Do you believe in Him before I have given you permission
Surely this is a plot which you have secretly devised in this city that you may turn out of it its people but you shall know
I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides then will I crucify you all together
They said Surely to our Lord shall we go back
And you do not take revenge on us except because we have believed in the communications of our Lord when they came to us
Our Lord Pour out upon us patience and cause us to die in submission
And the chiefs of Firon s people said Do you leave Musa and his people to make mischief in the land and to forsake you and your gods
He said We will slay their sons and spare their women and surely we are masters over them
Musa said to his people Ask help from Allah and be patient surely the land is Allah s He causes such of His servants to inherit it as He pleases and the end is for those who guard against evil
They said We have been persecuted before you came to us and since you have come to us
He said It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land then He will see how you act
And certainly We overtook Firon s people with droughts and diminution of fruits that they may be mindful
But when good befell them they said This is due to us and when evil afflicted them they attributed it to the illluck of Musa and those with him surely their evil fortune is only from Allah but most of them do not know
And they said Whatever sign you may bring to us to charm us with it we will not believe in you
Therefore We sent upon them widespread death and the locusts and the lice and the frog and the blood clear signs but they behaved haughtily and they were a guilty people
And when the plague fell upon them they said O Musa pray for us to your Lord as He has promised with you if you remove the plague from us we will certainly believe in you and we will certainly send away with you the children of Israel
But when We removed the plague from them till a term which they should attain lo they broke the promise
Therefore We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless of them
And We made the people who were deemed weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western ones which We had blessed and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the children of Israel because they bore up sufferings patiently and We utterly destroyed what Firon and his people had wrought and what they built
And We made the children of Israel to pass the sea then they came upon a people who kept to the worship of their idols They said O Musa make for us a god as they have their gods He said Surely you are a people acting ignorantly
As to these surely that about which they are shall be brought to naught and that which they do is vain
He said What shall I seek for you a god other than Allah while He has made you excel all created things
And when We delivered you from Firon s people who subjected you to severe torment killing your sons and sparing your women and in this there was a great trial from your Lord
And We appointed with Musa a time of thirty nights and completed them with ten more so the appointed time of his Lord was complete forty nights and Musa said to his brother Haroun Take my place among my people and act well and do not follow the way of the mischiefmakers
And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him he said My Lord show me Thyself so that I may look upon Thee He said You cannot bear to see Me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in its place then will you see Me but when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon then when he recovered he said Glory be to Thee I turn to Thee and I am the first of the believers
He said O Musa surely I have chosen you above the people with My messages and with My words therefore take hold of what I give to you and be of the grateful ones
And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of every kind and clear explanation of all things so take hold of them with firmness and enjoin your people to take hold of what is best thereof I will show you the abode of the transgressors
I will turn away from My communications those who are unjustly proud in the earth and if they see every sign they will not believe in It and if they see the way of rectitude they do not take It for a way and if they see the way of error they take it for a way this is because they rejected Our communications and were heedless of them
And as to those who reject Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter their deeds are null
Shall they be rewarded except for what they have done
And Musa s people made of their ornaments a calf after him a mere body which gave a mooing sound
What could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them in the way
They took it for worship and they were unjust
And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray they said If our Lord show not mercy to us and forgive us we shall certainly be of the losers
And when Musa returned to his people wrathful and in violent grief he said Evil is it that you have done after me did you turn away from the bidding of your Lord And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head dragging him towards him He said Son of my mother surely the people reckoned me weak and had wellnigh slain me therefore make not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the unjust people
He said My Lord forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful ones
As for those who took the calf for a god surely wrath from their Lord and disgrace in this world s life shall overtake them and thus do We recompense the devisers of lies
And as to those who do evil deeds then repent after that and believe your Lord after that is most surely Forgiving Merciful
And when Musa s anger calmed down he took up the tablets and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear for the sake of their Lord
And Musa chose out of his people seventy men for Our appointment so when the earthquake overtook them he said My Lord if Thou hadst pleased Thou hadst destroyed them before and myself too wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools among us have done It is naught but Thy trial Thou makest err with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest Thou art our Guardian therefore forgive us and have mercy on us and Thou art the best of the forgivers
And ordain for us good in this world s life and in the hereafter for surely we turn to Thee He said As for My chastisement I will afflict with it whom I please and My mercy encompasses all things so I will ordain it specially for those who guard against evil and pay the poorrate and those who believe in Our communications
Those who follow the ApostleProphet the Ummi whom they find written down with them in the Taurat and the Injeel who enjoins them good and forbids them evil and makes lawful to them the good things and makes unlawful to them impure things and removes from them their burden and the shackles which were upon them so as for those who believe in him and honor him and help him and follow the light which has been sent down with him these it is that are the successful
Say O people surely I am the Apostle of Allah to you all of Him Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth there is no god but He He brings to life and causes to die therefore believe in Allah and His apostle the Ummi Prophet who believes in Allah and His words and follow him so that you may walk in the right way
And of Musa s people was a party who guided people with the truth and thereby did they do justice
And We divided them into twelve tribes as nations and We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water Strike the rock with your staff so outnowed from it twelve springs each tribe knew its drinking place and We made the clouds to give shade over them and We sent to them manna and quails Eat of the good things We have given you And they did not do Us any harm but they did injustice to their own souls
And when it was said to them Reside in this town and eat from it wherever you wish and say Put down from us our heavy burdens and enter the gate making obeisance We will forgive you your wrongs We will give more to those who do good to others
But those who were unjust among them changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them so We sent upon them a pestilence from heaven because they were unjust
And ask them about the town which stood by the sea when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath when their fish came to them on the day of their Sabbath appearing on the surface of the water and on the day on which they did not keep the Sabbath they did not come to them thus did We try them because they transgressed
And when a party of them said Why do you admonish a with a severe chastisement They said To be free from blame before your Lord and that haply they may guard against evil
So when they neglected what they had been reminded of We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed
Therefore when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden We said to them Be as apes despised and hated
And when your Lord announced that He would certainly send against them to the day of resurrection those who would subject them to severe torment most surely your Lord is quick to requite evil and most surely He is Forgiving Merciful
And We cut them up on the earth into parties some of them being righteous and others of them falling short of that and We tried them with blessings and misfortunes that they might turn
Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the Book taking only the frail good of this low life and saying It will be forgiven us
And if the like good came to them they would take it too
Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth and they have read what is in it and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard against evil
Do you not then understand
And as for those who hold fast by the Book and keep up prayer surely We do not waste the reward of the right doers
And when We shook the mountain over them as if it were a covering overhead and they thought that it was going to fall down upon them Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be mindful of what is in it so that you may guard against evil
And when your Lord brought forth from the children of Adam from their backs their descendants and made them bear witness against their own souls Am I not your Lord They said Yes we bear witness
Lest you should say on the day of resurrection Surely we were heedless of this
Or you should say Only our fathers associated others with Allah before and we were an offspring after them Wilt Thou then destroy us for what the vain doers did
And thus do We make clear the communications and that haply they might return
And recite to them the narrative of him to whom We give Our communications but he withdraws himself from them so the Shaitan overtakes him so he is of those who go astray
And if We had pleased We would certainly have exalted him thereby but he clung to the earth and followed his low desire so his parable is as the parable of the dog if you attack him he lolls out his tongue and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue this is the parable of the people who reject Our communications therefore relate the narrative that they may reflect
Evil is the likeness of the people who reject Our communications and are unjust to their own souls
Whomsoever Allah guides he is the one who follows the right way and whomsoever He causes to err these are the losers
And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn and the men they have hearts with which they do not understand and they have eyes with which they do not see and they have ears with which they do not hear they are as cattle nay they are in worse errors these are the heedless ones
And Allah s are the best names therefore call on Him thereby and leave alone those who violate the sanctity of His names they shall be recompensed for what they did
And of those whom We have created are a people who guide with the truth and thereby they do justice
And as to those who reject Our communications We draw them near to destruction by degrees from whence they know not
And I grant them respite surely My scheme is effective
Do they not reflect that their companion has not unsoundness in mind he is only a plain warner
Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever things Allah has created and that may be their doom shall have drawn nigh what announcement would they then believe in after this
Whomsoever Allah causes to err there is no guide for him and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
They ask you about the hour when will be its taking place
Say The knowledge of it is only with my Lord none but He shall manifest it at its time it will be momentous in the heavens and the earth it will not come on you but of a sudden
They ask you as if you were solicitous about it
Say Its knowledge is only with Allah but most people do not know
Say I do not control any benefit or harm for my own soul except as Allah please and had I known the unseen I would have had much of good and no evil would have touched me I am nothing but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who believe
He it is Who created you from a single being and of the same kind did He make his mate that he might incline to her so when he covers her she bears a light burden then moves about with it but when it grows heavy they both call upon Allah their Lord If Thou givest us a good one we shall certainly be of the grateful ones
But when He gives them a good one they set up with Him associates in what He has given them but high is Allah above what they associate with Him
What they associate with Him that which does not create any thing while they are themselves created
And they have no power to give them help nor can they help themselves
And if you invite them to guidance they will not follow you it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent
Surely those whom you call on besides Allah are in a state of subjugation like yourselves therefore call on them then let them answer you if you are truthful
Have they feet with which they walk or have they hands with which they hold or have they eyes with which they see or have they ears with which they hear
Say Call your associates then make a struggle to prevail against me and give me no respite
Surely my guardian is Allah Who revealed the Book and He befriends the good
And those whom you call upon besides Him are not able to help you nor can they help themselves
And if you invite them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking towards you yet they do not see
Take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from the ignorant
And if a false imputation from the Shaitan afflict you seek refuge in Allah surely He is Hearing Knowing
Surely those who guard against evil when a visitation from the Shaitan afflicts them they become mindful then lo they see
And their brethren increase them in error then they cease not
And when you bring them not a revelation they say Why do you not forge it
Say I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord these are clear proofs from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
And when the Quran is recited then listen to it and remain silent that mercy may be shown to you
And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and fearing and in a voice not loud in the morning and the evening and be not of the heedless ones
Surely those who are with your Lord are not too proud to serve Him and they declare His glory and prostrate in humility before Him
They ask you about the windfalls
Say The windfalls are for Allah and the Apostle
So be careful of your duty to Allah and set aright matters of your difference and obey Allah and His Apostle if you are believers
Those only are believers whose hearts become full of fear when Allah is mentioned and when His communications are recited to them they increase them in faith and in their Lord do they trust
Those who keep up prayer and spend benevolently out of what We have given them
These are the believers in truth they shall have from their Lord exalted grades and forgiveness and an honorable sustenance
Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house with the truth though a party of the believers were surely averse
They disputed with you about the truth after it had become clear and they went forth as if they were being driven to death while they saw it
And when Allah promised you one of the two parties that it shall be yours and you loved that the one not armed should he yours and Allah desired to manifest the truth of what was true by His words and to cut off the root of the unbelievers
That He may manifest the truth of what was true and show the falsehood of what was false though the guilty disliked
When you sought aid from your Lord so He answered you I will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one another
And Allah only gave it as a good news and that your hearts might be at ease thereby and victory is only from Allah surely Allah is Mighty Wise
When He caused calm to fall on you as a security from Him and sent down upon you water from the cloud that He might thereby purify you and take away from you the uncleanness of the Shaitan and that He might fortify your hearts and steady your footsteps thereby
When your Lord revealed to the angels I am with you therefore make firm those who believe
I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve
Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them
This is because they acted adversely to Allah and His Apostle and whoever acts adversely to Allah and His Apostle then surely Allah is severe in requiting evil
This taste it and know that for the unbelievers is the chastisement of fire
O you who believe when you meet those who disbelieve marching for war then turn not your backs to them
And whoever shall turn his back to them on that day unless he turn aside for the sake of fighting or withdraws to a company then he indeed becomes deserving of Allah s wrath and his abode is hell and an evil destination shall it be
So you did not slay them but it was Allah Who slew them and you did not smite when you smote the enemy but it was Allah Who smote and that He might confer upon the believers a good gift from Himself surely Allah is Hearing Knowing
This and that Allah is the weakener of the struggle of the unbelievers
If you demanded a judgment the judgment has then indeed come to you and if you desist it will be better for you and if you turn back to fight We too shall turn back and your forces shall avail you nothing though they may be many and know that Allah is with the believers
O you who believe obey Allah and His Apostle and do not turn back from Him while you hear
And be not like those who said We hear and they did not obey
Surely the vilest of animals in Allah s sight are the deaf the dumb who do not understand
And if Allah had known any good in them He would have made them hear and if He makes them hear they would turn back while they withdraw
O you who believe answer the call of Allah and His Apostle when he calls you to that which gives you life and know that Allah intervenes between man and his heart and that to Him you shall be gathered
And fear an affliction which may not smite those of you in particular who are unjust and know that Allah is severe in requiting evil
And remember when you were few deemed weak in the land fearing lest people might carry you off by force but He sheltered you and strengthened you with His aid and gave you of the good things that you may give thanks
O you who believe be not unfaithful to Allah and the Apostle nor be unfaithful to your trusts while you know
And know that your property and your children are a temptation and that Allah is He with Whom there is a mighty reward
O you who believe
If you are careful of your duty to Allah He will grant you a distinction and do away with your evils and forgive you and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
And when those who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine you or slay you or drive you away and they devised plans and Allah too had arranged a plan and Allah is the best of planners
And when Our communications are recited to them they say We have heard indeed if we pleased we could say the like of it this is nothing but the stories of the ancients
And when they said O Allah if this is the truth from Thee then rain upon us stones from heaven or inflict on us a painful punishment
But Allah was not going to chastise them while you were among them nor is Allah going to chastise them while yet they ask for forgiveness
And what excuse have they that Allah should not chastise them while they hinder men from the Sacred Mosque and they are not fit to be guardians of it its guardians are only those who guard against evil but most of them do not know
And their prayer before the House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands taste then the chastisement for you disbelieved
Surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder people from the way of Allah so they shall spend it then it shall be to them an intense regret then they shall be overcome and those who disbelieve shall be driven together to hell
That Allah might separate the impure from the good and put the impure some of it upon the other and pile it up together then cast it into hell these it is that are the losers
Say to those who disbelieve if they desist that which is past shall be forgiven to them and if they return then what happened to the ancients has already passed
And fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for Allah but if they desist then surely Allah sees what they do
And if they turn back then know that Allah is your Patron most excellent is the Patron and most excellent the Helper
And know that whatever thing you gain a fifth of it is for Allah and for the Apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if you believe in Allah and in that which We revealed to Our servant on the day of distinction the day on which the two parties met and Allah has power over all things
When you were on the nearer side of the valley and they were on the farthest side while the caravan was in a lower place than you and if you had mutually made an appointment you would certainly have broken away from the appointment but in order that Allah might bring about a matter which was to be done that he who would perish might perish by clear proof and he who would live might live by clear proof and most surely Allah is Hearing Knowing
When Allah showed them to you in your dream as few and if He had shown them to you as many you would certainly have become weakhearted and you would have disputed about the matter but Allah saved you surely He is the Knower of what is in the breasts
And when He showed them to you when you met as few in your eyes and He made you to appear little in their eyes in order that Allah might bring about a matter which was to be done and to Allah are all affairs returned
O you who believe when you meet a party then be firm and remember Allah much that you may be successful
And obey Allah and His Apostle and do not quarrel for then you will be weak in hearts and your power will depart and be patient surely Allah is with the patient
And be not like those who came forth from their homes in great exultation and to be seen of men and who turn away from the way of Allah and Allah comprehends what they do
And when the Shaitan made their works fair seeming to them and said No one can overcome you this day and surely I am your protector but when the two parties came in sight of each other he turned upon his heels and said Surely I am clear of you surely I see what you do not see surely I fear Allah and Allah is severe in requiting evil
When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease said Their religion has deceived them and whoever trusts in Allah then surely Allah is Mighty Wise
And had you seen when the angels will cause to die those who disbelieve smiting their faces and their backs and saying Taste the punishment of burning
This is for what your own hands have sent on before and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants
In the manner of the people of Firon and those before them they disbelieved in Allah s communications therefore Allah destroyed them on account of their faults surely Allah is strong severe in requiting evil
This is because Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition and because Allah is Hearing Knowing
In the manner of the people of Firon and those before them they rejected the communications of their Lord therefore We destroyed them on account of their faults and We drowned Firon s people and they were all unjust
Surely the vilest of animals in Allah s sight are those who disbelieve then they would not believe
Those with whom you make an agreement then they break their agreement every time and they do not guard against punishment
Therefore if you overtake them in fighting then scatter by making an example of them those who are in their rear that they may be mindful
And if you fear treachery on the part of a people then throw back to them on terms of equality surely Allah does not love the treacherous
And let not those who disbelieve think that they shall come in first surely they will not escape
And prepare against them what force you can and horses tied at the frontier to frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but Allah knows them and whatever thing you will spend in Allah s way it will be paid back to you fully and you shall not be dealt with unjustly
And if they incline to peace then incline to it and trust in Allah surely He is the Hearing the Knowing
And if they intend to deceive you then surely Allah is sufficient for you He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers
And united their hearts had you spent all that is in the earth you could not have united their hearts but Allah united them surely He is Mighty Wise
O Prophet
Allah is sufficient for you and for such of the believers as follow you
O Prophet urge the believers to war if there are twenty patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a hundred of you they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve because they are a people who do not understand
For the present Allah has made light your burden and He knows that there is weakness in you so if there are a hundred patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a thousand they shall overcome two thousand by Allah s permission and Allah is with the patient
It is not fit for a prophet that he should take captives unless he has fought and triumphed in the land you desire the frail goods of this world while Allah desires for you the hereafter and Allah is Mighty Wise
Were it not for an ordinance from Allah that had already gone forth surely there would have befallen you a great chastisement for what you had taken to
Eat then of the lawful and good things which you have acquired in war and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O Prophet say to those of the captives who are in your hands If Allah knows anything good in your hearts He will give to you better than that which has been taken away from you and will forgive you and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if they intend to act unfaithfully towards you so indeed they acted unfaithfully towards Allah before but He gave you mastery over them and Allah is Knowing Wise
Surely those who believed and fled their homes and struggled hard in Allah s way with their property and their souls and those who gave shelter and helped these are guardians of each other and as for those who believed and did not fly not yours is their guardianship until they fly and if they seek aid from you in the matter of religion aid is incumbent on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty and Allah sees what you do
And as for those who disbelieve some of them are the guardians of others if you will not do it there will be in the land persecution and great mischief
And as for those who believed and fled and struggled hard in Allah s way and those who gave shelter and helped these are the believers truly they shall have forgiveness and honorable provision
And as for those who believed afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you they are of you and the possessors of relationships are nearer to each other in the ordinance of Allah surely Allah knows all things
This is a declaration of immunity by Allah and His Apostle towards those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement
So go about in the land for four months and know that you cannot weaken Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to the unbelievers
And an announcement from Allah and His Apostle to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Apostle are free from liability to the idolaters therefore if you repent it will be better for you and if you turn back then know that you will not weaken Allah and announce painful punishment to those who disbelieve
Except those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up any one against you so fulfill their agreement to the end of their term surely Allah loves those who are careful of their duty
So when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate leave their way free to them surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if one of the idolaters seek protection from you grant him protection till he hears the word of Allah then make him attain his place of safety this is because they are a people who do not know
How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with Allah and with His Apostle except those with whom you made an agreement at the Sacred Mosque
So as long as they are true to you be true to them surely Allah loves those who are careful of their duty
How can it be while if they prevail against you they would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship nor those of covenant they please you with their mouths while their hearts do not consent and most of them are transgressors
They have taken a small price for the communications of Allah so they turn away from His way surely evil is it that they do
They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of covenant in the case of a believer and these are they who go beyond the limits
But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate they are your brethren in faith and We make the communications clear for a people who know
And if they break their oaths after their agreement and openly revile your religion then fight the leaders of unbelief surely their oaths are nothing so that they may desist
What will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the Apostle and they attacked you first do you fear them
But Allah is most deserving that you should fear Him if you are believers
Fight them Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace and assist you against them and heal the hearts of a believing people
And remove the rage of their hearts and Allah turns mercifully to whom He pleases and Allah is Knowing Wise
What do you think that you will be left alone while Allah has not yet known those of you who have struggled hard and have not taken any one as an adherent besides Allah and His Apostle and the believers and Allah is aware of what you do
The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of Allah while bearing witness to unbelief against themselves these it is whose doings are null and in the fire shall they abide
Only he shall visit the mosques of Allah who believes in Allah and the latter day and keeps up prayer and pays the poorrate and fears none but Allah so as for these it may be that they are of the followers of the right course
What do you make one who undertakes the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in Allah s way
They are not equal with Allah and Allah does not guide the unjust people
Those who believed and fled their homes and strove hard in Allah s way with their property and their souls are much higher in rank with Allah and those are they who are the achievers of their objects
Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself and His good pleasure and gardens wherein lasting blessings shall be theirs
Abiding therein for ever surely Allah has a Mighty reward with Him
O you who believe do not take your fathers and your brothers for guardians if they love unbelief more than belief and whoever of you takes them for a guardian these it is that are the unjust
Say If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have acquired and the slackness of trade which you fear and dwellings which you like are dearer to you than Allah and His Apostle and striving in His way then wait till Allah brings about His command and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain when your great numbers made you vain but they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness then you turned back retreating
Then Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His Apostle and upon the believers and sent down hosts which you did not see and chastised those who disbelieved and that is the reward of the unbelievers
Then will Allah after this turn mercifully to whom He pleases and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe the idolaters are nothing but unclean so they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year and if you fear poverty then Allah will enrich you out of His grace if He please surely Allah is Knowing Wise
Fight those who do not believe in Allah nor in the latter day nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have prohibited nor follow the religion of truth out of those who have been given the Book until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection
And the Jews say Uzair is the son of Allah and the Christians say The Messiah is the son of Allah these are the words of their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before may Allah destroy them how they are turned away
They have taken their doctors of law and their monks for lords besides Allah and also the Messiah son of Marium and they were enjoined that they should serve one Allah only there is no god but He far from His glory be what they set up with Him
They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light though the unbelievers are averse
He it is Who sent His Apostle with guidance and the religion of truth that He might cause it to prevail over all religions though the polytheists may be averse
O you who believe most surely many of the doctors of law and the monks eat away the property of men falsely and turn them from Allah s way and as for those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah s way announce to them a painful chastisement
On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell then their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it this is what you hoarded up for yourselves therefore taste what you hoarded
Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months in Allah s ordinance since the day when He created the heavens and the earth of these four being sacred that is the right reckoning therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together and know that Allah is with those who guard against evil
Postponing of the sacred month is only an addition in unbelief wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray violating it one year and keeping it sacred another that they may agree in the number of months that Allah has made sacred and thus violate what Allah has made sacred the evil of their doings is made fairseeming to them and Allah does not guide the unbelieving people
O you who believe
What excuse have you that when it is said to you Go forth in Allah s way you should incline heavily to earth are you contented with this world s life instead of the hereafter
But the provision of this world s life compared with the hereafter is but little
If you do not go forth He will chastise you with a painful chastisement and bring in your place a people other than you and you will do Him no harm and Allah has power over all things
If you will not aid him Allah certainly aided him when those who disbelieved expelled him he being the second of the two when they were both in the cave when he said to his companion Grieve not surely Allah is with us So Allah sent down His tranquillity upon him and strengthened him with hosts which you did not see and made lowest the word of those who disbelieved and the word of Allah that is the highest and Allah is Mighty Wise
Go forth light and heavy and strive hard in Allah s way with your property and your persons this is better for you if you know
Had it been a near advantage and a short journey they would certainly have followed you but the tedious journey was too long for them and they swear by Allah If we had been able we would certainly have gone forth with you they cause their own souls to perish and Allah knows that they are most surely
Allah pardon you
Why did you give them leave until those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you had known the liars
They do not ask leave of you who believe in Allah and the latter day to stay away from striving hard with their property and their persons and Allah knows those who guard against evil
They only ask leave of you who do not believe in Allah and the latter day and their hearts are in doubt so in their doubt do they waver
And if they had intended to go forth they would certainly have provided equipment for it but Allah did not like their going forth so He withheld them and it was said to them Hold back with those who hold back
Had they gone forth with you they would not have added to you aught save corruption and they would certainly have hurried about among you seeking to sow dissension among you and among you there are those who hearken for their sake and Allah knows the unjust
Certainly they sought to sow dissension before and they meditated plots against you until the truth came and Allah s commandment prevailed although they were averse from it
And among them there is he who says Allow me and do not try me
Surely into trial have they already tumbled down and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers
If good befalls you it grieves them and if hardship afflicts you they say Indeed we had taken care of our affair before and they turn back and are glad
Say Nothing will afflict us save what Allah has ordained for us He is our Patron and on Allah let the believers rely
Say Do you await for us but one of two most excellent things And we await for you that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or by our hands
So wait we too will wait with you
Say Spend willingly or unwillingly it shall not be accepted from you surely you are a transgressing people
And nothing hinders their spendings being accepted from them except that they disbelieve in Allah and in His Apostle and they do not come to prayer but while they are sluggish and they do not spend but while they are unwilling
Let not then their property and their children excite your admiration Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this world s life and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers
And they swear by Allah that they are most surely of you and they are not of you but they are a people who are afraid of you
If they could find a refuge or cave or a place to enter into they would certainly have turned thereto running away in all haste
And of them there are those who blame you with respect to the alms so if they are given from it they are pleased and if they are not given from it lo they are full of rage
And if they were content with what Allah and His Apostle gave them and had said Allah is sufficient for us Allah will soon give us more out of His grace and His Apostle too surely to Allah do we make our petition
Alms are only for the poor and the needy and the officials appointed over them and those whose hearts are made to incline to truth and the ransoming of captives and those in debts and in the way of Allah and the wayfarer an ordinance from Allah and Allah is knowing Wise
And there are some of them who molest the Prophet and say He is one who believes every thing that he hears say A hearer of good for you who believes in Allah and believes the faithful and a mercy for those of you who believe and as for those who molest the Apostle of Allah they shall have a painful punishment
They swear to you by Allah that they might please you and Allah as well as His Apostle has a greater right that they should please Him if they are believers
Do they not know that whoever acts in opposition to Allah and His Apostle he shall surely have the fire of hell to abide in it
That is the grievous abasement
The hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be sent down to them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts
Say Go on mocking surely Allah will bring forth what you fear
And if you should question them they would certainly say We were only idly discoursing and sporting
Say Was it at Allah and His communications and His Apostle that you mocked
Do not make excuses you have denied indeed after you had believed if We pardon a party of you We will chastise another party because they are guilty
The hypocritical men and the hypocritical women are all alike they enjoin evil and forbid good and withhold their hands they have forsaken Allah so He has forsaken them surely the hypocrites are the transgressors
Allah has promised the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the unbelievers the fire of hell to abide therein it is enough for them and Allah has cursed them and they shall have lasting punishment
Like those before you they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children so they enjoyed their portion thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion and you entered into vain discourses like the vain discourses in which entered those before you These are they whose works are null in this world and the hereafter and these are they who are the losers
Has not the news of those before them come to them of the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood and the people of Ibrahim and the dwellers of Madyan and the overthrown cities their apostles came to them with clear arguments so it was not Allah Who should do them injustice but they were unjust to themselves
And as for the believing men and the believing women they are guardians of each other they enjoin good and forbid evil and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and obey Allah and His Apostle as for these Allah will show mercy to them surely Allah is Mighty Wise
Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode and best of all is Allah s goodly pleasure that is the grand achievement
O Prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them and their abode is hell and evil is the destination
They swear by Allah that they did not speak and certainly they did speak the word of unbelief and disbelieved after their Islam and they had determined upon what they have not been able to effect and they did not find fault except because Allah and His Apostle enriched them out of His grace therefore if they repent it will be good for them and if they turn back Allah will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the hereafter and they shall not have in the land any guardian or a helper
And there are those of them who made a covenant with Allah If He give us out of His grace we will certainly give alms and we will certainly be of the good
But when He gave them out of His grace they became niggardly of it and they turned back and they withdrew
So He made hypocrisy to follow as a consequence into their hearts till the day when they shall meet Him because they failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with Him and because they told lies
Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts and their secret counsels and that Allah is the great Knower of the unseen things
They who taunt those of the faithful who give their alms freely and those who give to the extent of their earnings and scoff at them Allah will pay them back their scoffing and they shall have a painful chastisement
Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them this is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
Those who were left behind were glad on account of their sitting behind Allah s Apostle and they were averse from striving in Allah s way with their property and their persons and said Do not go forth in the heat
Say The fire of hell is much severe in heat
Would that they understood it
Therefore they shall laugh little and weep much as a recompense for what they earned
Therefore if Allah brings you back to a party of them and then they ask your permission to go forth say By no means shall you ever go forth with me and by no means shall you fight an enemy with me surely you chose to sit the first time therefore sit now with those who remain behind
And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and do not stand by his grave surely they disbelieve in Allah and His Apostle and they shall die in transgression
And let not their property and their children excite your admiration Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this world and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers
And whenever a chapter is revealed saying Believe in Allah and strive hard along with His Apostle those having ampleness of means ask permission of you and say Leave us behind that we may be with those who sit
They preferred to be with those who remained behind and a seal is set on their hearts so they do not understand
But the Apostle and those who believe with him strive hard with their property and their persons and these it is who shall have the good things and these it is who shall be successful
Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them that is the great achievement
And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert came that permission may be given to them and they sat at home who lied to Allah and His Apostle a painful chastisement shall afflict those of them who disbelieved
It shall be no crime in the weak nor in the sick nor in those who do not find what they should spend to stay behind so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Apostle there is no way to blame against the doers of good and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Nor in those who when they came to you that you might carry them you said I cannot find that on which to carry you they went back while their eyes overflowed with tears on account of grief for not finding that which they should spend
The way to blame is only against those who ask permission of you though they are rich they have chosen to be with those who remained behind and Allah has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know
They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to them Say Urge no excuse by no means will we believe you indeed Allah has informed us of matters relating to you and now Allah and His Apostle will see your doings then you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen then He will inform you of what you did
They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them so that you may turn aside from them so do turn aside from them surely they are unclean and their abode is hell a recompense for what they earned
They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people
The dwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief and hypocrisy and more disposed not to know the limits of what Allah has revealed to His Apostle and Allah is Knowing Wise
And of the dwellers of the desert are those who take what they spend to be a fine and they wait the befalling of calamities to you on them will be the evil calamity and Allah is Hearing Knowing
And of the dwellers of the desert are those who believe in Allah and the latter day and take what they spend to be means of the nearness of Allah and the Apostle s prayers surely it shall be means of nearness for them Allah will make them enter into His mercy surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And as for the foremost the first of the Muhajirs and the Ansars and those who followed them in goodness Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them for ever that is the mighty achievement
And from among those who are round about you of the dwellers of the desert there are hypocrites and from among the people of Medina also they are stubborn in hypocrisy you do not know them We know them We will chastise them twice then shall they be turned back to a grievous chastisement
And others have confessed their faults they have mingled a good deed and an evil one may be Allah will turn to them mercifully surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Take alms out of their property you would cleanse them and purify them thereby and pray for them surely your prayer is a relief to them and Allah is Hearing Knowing
Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and takes the alms and that Allah is the Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
And say Work so Allah will see your work and so will His Apostle and the believers and you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen then He will inform you of what you did
And others are made to await Allah s command whether He chastise them or whether He turn to them mercifully and Allah is Knowing Wise
And those who built a masjid to cause harm and for unbelief and to cause disunion among the believers and an ambush to him who made war against Allah and His Apostle before and they will certainly swear We did not desire aught but good and Allah bears witness that they are most surely liars
Never stand in it certainly a masjid founded on piety from the very first day is more deserving that you should stand in it in it are men who love that they should be purified and Allah loves those who purify themselves
Is he therefore better who lays his foundation on fear of Allah and His good pleasure or he who lays his foundation on the edge of a cracking hollowed bank so it broke down with him into the fire of hell and Allah does not guide the unjust people
The building which they have built will ever continue to be a source of disquiet in their hearts except that their hearts get cut into pieces and Allah is Knowing Wise
Surely Allah has bought of the believers their persons and their property for this that they shall have the garden they fight in Allah s way so they slay and are slain a promise which is binding on Him in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Quran and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah
Rejoice therefore in the pledge which you have made and that is the mighty achievement
They who turn to Allah who serve Him who praise Him who fast who bow down who prostrate themselves who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil and who keep the limits of Allah and give good news to the believers
It is not fit for the Prophet and those who believe that they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists even though they should be near relatives after it has become clear to them that they are inmates of the flaming fire
And Ibrahim asking forgiveness for his sire was only owing to a promise which he had made to him but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah he declared himself to be clear of him most surely Ibrahim was very tenderhearted forbearing
It is not attributable to Allah that He should lead a people astray after He has guided them He even makes clear to them what they should guard against surely Allah knows all things
Surely Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He brings to life and causes to die and there is not for you besides Allah any Guardian or Helper
Certainly Allah has turned mercifully to the Prophet and those who fled their homes and the helpers who followed him in the hour of straitness after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate then He turned to them mercifully surely to them He is Compassionate Merciful
And to the three who were left behind until the earth became strait to them notwithstanding its spaciousness and their souls were also straitened to them and they knew it for certain that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him then He turned to them mercifully that they might turn to Him surely Allah is the Oftreturning to mercy the Merciful
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah and be with the true ones
It did not beseem the people of Medina and those round about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain behind the Apostle of Allah nor should they desire anything for themselves in preference to him this is because there afflicts them not thirst or fatigue or hunger in Allah s way nor do they tread a path which enrages the unbelievers nor do they attain from the enemy what they attain but a good work is written down to them on account of it surely Allah does not waste the reward of the doers of good
Nor do they spend anything that may be spent small or great nor do they traverse a valley but it is written down to their credit that Allah may reward them with the best of what they have done
And it does not beseem the believers that they should go forth all together why should not then a company from every party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion and that they may warn their people when they come back to them that they may be cautious
O you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness and know that Allah is with those who guard against evil
And whenever a chapter is revealed there are some of them who say Which of you has it strengthened in faith
Then as for those who believe it strengthens them in faith and they rejoice
And as for those in whose hearts is a disease it adds uncleanness to their uncleanness and they die while they are unbelievers
Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year yet they do not turn to Allah nor do they mind
And whenever a chapter is revealed they cast glances at one another Does any one see you
Then they turn away Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do not understand
Certainly an Apostle has come to you from among yourselves grievous to him is your falling into distress excessively solicitous respecting you to the believers he is compassionate
But if they turn back say Allah is sufficient for me there is no god but He on Him do I rely and He is the Lord of mighty power
Alif Lam Ra
These are the verses of the wise Book
What is it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a man from among themselves saying Warn the people and give good news to those who believe that theirs is a footing of firmness with their Lord The unbelievers say This is most surely a manifest enchanter
Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods and He is firm in power regulating the affair there is no intercessor except after His permission this is Allah your Lord therefore serve Him will you not then mind
To Him is your return of all of you the promise of Allah made in truth surely He begins the creation in the first instance then He reproduces it that He may with justice recompense those who believe and do good and as for those who disbelieve they shall have a drink of hot water and painful punishment because they disbelieved
He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness and the moon a light and ordained for it mansions that you might know the computation of years and the reckoning
Allah did not create it but with truth He makes the signs manifest for a people who know
Most surely in the variation of the night and the day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth there are signs for a people who guard against evil
Surely those who do not hope in Our meeting and are pleased with this world s life and are content with it and those who are heedless of Our communications
As for those their abode is the fire because of what they earned
Surely as for those who believe and do good their Lord will guide them by their faith there shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss
Their cry in it shall be Glory to Thee O Allah and their greeting in it shall be Peace and the last of their cry shall be Praise be to Allah the Lord of the worlds
And if Allah should hasten the evil to men as they desire the hastening on of good their doom should certainly have been decreed for them but We leave those alone who hope not for Our meeting in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
And when affliction touches a man he calls on Us whether lying on his side or sitting or standing but when We remove his affliction from him he passes on as though he had never called on Us on account of an affliction that touched him thus that which they do is made fairseeming to the extravagant
And certainly We did destroy generations before you when they were unjust and their apostles had come to them with clear arguments and they would not believe thus do We recompense the guilty people
Then We made you successors in the land after them so that We may see how you act
And when Our clear communications are recited to them those who hope not for Our meeting say Bring a Quran other than this or change it
Say It does not beseem me that I should change it of myself I follow naught but what is revealed to me surely I fear if I disobey my Lord the punishment of a mighty day
Say If Allah had desired otherwise I would not have recited it to you nor would He have taught it to you indeed I have lived a lifetime among you before it do you not then understand
Who is then more unjust than who forges a lie against Allah or who gives the lie to His communications
Surely the guilty shall not be successful
And they serve beside Allah what can neither harm them nor profit them and they say These are our intercessors with Allah
Say Do you presume to inform Allah of what He knows not in the heavens and the earth
Glory be to Him and supremely exalted is He above what they set up with Him
And people are naught but a single nation so they disagree and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord the matter would have certainly been decided between them in respect of that concerning which they disagree
And they say Why is not a sign sent to him from his Lord
Say The unseen is only for Allah therefore wait surely I too with you am of those who wait
And when We make people taste of mercy after an affliction touches them lo they devise plans against Our communication
Say Allah is quicker to plan surely Our apostles write down what you plan
He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea until when you are in the ships and they sail on with them in a pleasant breeze and they rejoice a violent wind overtakes them and the billows surge in on them from all sides and they become certain that they are encompassed about they pray to Allah being sincere to Him in obedience If Thou dost deliver us from this we will most certainly be of the grateful ones
But when He delivers them lo they are unjustly rebellious in the earth
O men your rebellion is against your own souls provision only of this world s life then to Us shall be your return so We will inform you of what you did
The likeness of this world s life is only as water which We send down from the cloud then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished and its people think that they have power over it Our command comes to it by night or by day so We render it as reaped seed produce as though it had not been in existence yesterday thus do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect
And Allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whom He pleases into the right path
For those who do good is good reward and more than this and blackness or ignominy shall not cover their faces these are the dwellers of the garden in it they shall abide
And as for those who have earned evil the punishment of an evil is the like of it and abasement shall come upon them they shall have none to protect them from Allah as if their faces had been covered with slices of the dense darkness of night these are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide
And on the day when We will gather them all together then We will say to those who associated others with Allah Keep where you are you and your associates then We shall separate them widely one from another and their associates would say It was not us that you served
Therefore Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you that we were quite unaware of your serving us
There shall every soul become acquainted with what it sent before and they shall be brought back to Allah their true Patron and what they devised shall escape from them
Say Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth
Or Who controls the hearing and the sight
And Who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living
And Who regulates the affairs
Then they will say Allah
Say then Will you not then guard against evil
This then is Allah your true Lord and what is there after the truth but error how are you then turned back
Thus does the word of your Lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not believe
Say Is there any one among your associates who can bring into existence the creation in the first instance then reproduce it
Say Allah brings the creation into existence then He reproduces it how are you then turned away
Say Is there any of your associates who guides to the truth
Say Allah guides to the truth
Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided
What then is the matter with you how do you judge
And most of them do not follow anything but conjecture surely conjecture will not avail aught against the truth surely Allah is cognizant of what they do
And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah but it is a verification of that which is before it and a clear explanation of the book there is no doubt in it from the Lord of the worlds
Or do they say He has forged it
Say Then bring a chapter like this and invite whom you can besides Allah if you are truthful
Nay they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them even thus did those before them reject the truth see then what was the end of the unjust
And of them is he who believes in it and of them is he who does not believe in it and your Lord best knows the mischiefmakers
And if they call you a liar say My work is for me and your work for you you are clear of what I do and I am clear of what you do
And there are those of them who hear you but can you make the deaf to hear though they will not understand
And there are those of them who look at you but can you show the way to the blind though they will not see
Surely Allah does not do any injustice to men but men are unjust to themselves
And on the day when He will gather them as though they had not stayed but an hour of the day they will know each other
They will perish indeed who called the meeting with Allah to be a lie and they are not followers of the right direction
And if We show you something of what We threaten them with or cause you to die yet to Us is their return and Allah is the bearer of witness to what they do
And every nation had an apostle so when their apostle came the matter was decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
And they say When will this threat come about if you are truthful
Say I do not control for myself any harm or any benefit except what Allah pleases every nation has a term when their term comes they shall not then remain behind for an hour nor can they go before their time
Say Tell me if His punishment overtakes you by night or by day what then is there of it that the guilty would hasten on
And when it comes to pass will you believe in it
What now you believe and already you wished to have it hastened on
Then it shall be said to those who were unjust Taste abiding chastisement you are not requited except for what you earned
And they ask you Is that true
Say Aye by my Lord it is most surely the truth and you will not escape
And if every soul that has done injustice had all that is in the earth it would offer it for ransom and they will manifest regret when they see the chastisement and the matter shall be decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Now surely Allah s is what is in the heavens and the earth now surely Allah s promise is true but most of them do not know
He gives life and causes death and to Him you shall be brought back
O men there has come to you indeed an admonition from your Lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
Say In the grace of Allah and in His mercy in that they should rejoice it is better than that which they gather
Say Tell me what Allah has sent down for you of sustenance then you make a part of it unlawful and a part lawful
Say Has Allah commanded you or do you forge a lie against Allah
And what will be the thought of those who forge lies against Allah on the day of resurrection
Most surely Allah is the Lord of grace towards men but most of them do not give thanks
And you are not engaged in any affair nor do you recite concerning it any portion of the Quran nor do you do any work but We are witnesses over you when you enter into it and there does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven nor any thing less than that nor greater but it is in a clear book
Now surely the friends of Allah they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Those who believe and guarded against evil
They shall have good news in this world s life and in the hereafter there is no changing the words of Allah that is the mighty achievement
And let not their speech grieve you surely might is wholly Allah s He is the Hearing the Knowing
Now surely whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah s and they do not really follow any associates who call on others besides Allah they do not follow anything but conjectures and they only lie
He it is Who made for you the night that you might rest in it and the day giving light most surely there are signs in it for a people who would hear
They say Allah has taken a son to Himself Glory be to Him He is the Selfsufficient His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth you have no authority for this do you say against Allah what you do not know
Say Those who forge a lie against Allah shall not be successful
It is only a provision in this world then to Us shall be their return then We shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved
And recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his people O my people if my stay and my reminding you by the communications of Allah is hard on you yet on Allah do I rely then resolve upon your affair and gather your associates then let not your affair remain dubious to you then have it executed against me and give me no respite
But if you turn back I did not ask for any reward from you my reward is only with Allah and I am commanded that I should be of those who submit
But they rejected him so We delivered him and those with him in the ark and We made them rulers and drowned those who rejected Our communications see then what was the end of the people warned
Then did We raise up after him apostles to their people so they came to them with clear arguments but they would not believe in what they had rejected before thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits
Then did We send up after them Musa and Haroun to Firon and his chiefs with Our signs but they showed pride and they were a guilty people
So when the truth came to them from Us they said This is most surely clear enchantment
Musa said Do you say this of the truth when it has come to you
Is it magic
And the magicians are not successful
They said Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon and that greatness in the land should be for you two
And we are not going to believe in you
And Firon said Bring to me every skillful magician
And when the magicians came Musa said to them Cast down what you have to cast
So when they cast down Musa said to them What you have brought is deception surely Allah will make it naught surely Allah does not make the work of mischiefmakers to thrive
And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His words though the guilty may be averse to it
But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his people on account of the fear of Firon and their chiefs lest he should persecute them and most surely Firon was lofty in the land and most surely he was of the extravagant
And Musa said O my people if you believe in Allah then rely on Him alone if you submit to Allah
So they said On Allah we rely O our Lord make us not subject to the persecution of the unjust people
And do Thou deliver us by Thy mercy from the unbelieving people
And We revealed to Musa and his brother saying Take for your people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of worship and keep up prayer and give good news to the believers
And Musa said Our Lord surely Thou hast given to Firon and his chiefs finery and riches in this world s life to this end our Lord that they lead people astray from Thy way Our Lord destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they see the painful punishment
He said The prayer of you both has indeed been accepted therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know
And We made the children of Israel to pass through the sea then Firon and his hosts followed them for oppression and tyranny until when drowning overtook him he said I believe that there is no god but He in Whom the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit
What now and indeed you disobeyed before and you were of the mischiefmakers
But We will this day deliver you with your body that you may be a sign to those after you and most surely the majority of the people are heedless to Our communications
And certainly We lodged the children of Israel in a goodly abode and We provided them with good things but they did not disagree until the knowledge had come to them surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that in which they disagreed
But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you ask those who read the Book before you certainly the truth has come to you from your Lord therefore you should not be of the disputers
And you should not be of those who reject the communications of Allah for then you should be one of the losers
Surely those against whom the word of your Lord has proved true will not believe
Though every sign should come to them until they witness the painful chastisement
And wherefore was there not a town which should believe so that their belief should have profited them but the people of Yunus
When they believed We removed from them the chastisement of disgrace in this world s life and We gave them provision till a time
And if your Lord had pleased surely all those who are in the earth would have believed all of them will you then force men till they become believers
And it is not for a soul to believe except by Allah s permission and He casts uncleanness on those who will not understand
Say Consider what is it that is in the heavens and the earth and signs and warners do not avail a people who would not believe
What do they wait for then but the like of the days of those who passed away before them
Say Wait then surely I too am with you of those who wait
Then We deliver Our apostles and those who believe even so now it is binding on Us that We deliver the believers
Say O people if you are in doubt as to my religion then know that I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah but I do serve Allah Who will cause you to die and I am commanded that I should be of the believers
And that you should keep your course towards the religion uprightly and you should not be of the polytheists
And do not call besides Allah on that which can neither benefit you nor harm you for if you do then surely you will in that case be of the unjust
And if Allah should afflict you with harm then there is none to remove it but He and if He intends good to you there is none to repel His grace He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants and He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Say O people indeed there has come to you the truth from your Lord therefore whoever goes aright he goes aright only for the good of his own soul and whoever goes astray he goes astray only to the detriment of it and I am not a custodian over you
And follow what is revealed to you and be patient till Allah should give judgment and He is the best of the judges
Alif Lam Ra This is a Book whose verses are made decisive then are they made plain from the Wise Allaware
That you shall not serve any but Allah surely I am a warner for you from Him and a giver of good news
And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord then turn to Him He will provide you with a goodly provision to an appointed term and bestow His grace on every one endowed with grace and if you turn back then surely I fear for you the chastisement of a great day
To Allah is your return and He has power over all things
Now surely they fold up their breasts that they may conceal their enmity from Him now surely when they use their garments as a covering He knows what they conceal and what they make public surely He knows what is in the breasts
And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the sustenance of it and He knows its resting place and its depository all things are in a manifest book
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods and His dominion extends on the water that He might manifest to you which of you is best in action and if you say surely you shall be raised up after death those who disbelieve would certainly say This is nothing but clear magic
And if We hold back from them the punishment until a stated period of time they will certainly say What prevents it
Now surely on the day when it will come to them it shall not be averted from them and that which they scoffed at shall beset them
And if We make man taste mercy from Us then take it off from him most surely he is despairing ungrateful
And if We make him taste a favor after distress has afflicted him he will certainly say The evils are gone away from me Most surely he is exulting boasting
Except those who are patient and do good they shall have forgiveness and a great reward
Then it may be that you will give up part of what is revealed to you and your breast will become straitened by it because they say Why has not a treasure been sent down upon him or an angel come with him
You are only a warner and Allah is custodian over all things
Or do they say He has forged it
Say Then bring ten forged chapters like it and call upon whom you can besides Allah if you are truthful
But if they do not answer you then know that it is revealed by Allah s knowledge and that there is no god but He will you then submit
Whoever desires this world s life and its finery We will pay them in full their deeds therein and they shall not be made to suffer loss in respect of them
These are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the hereafter and what they wrought in it shall go for nothing and vain is what they do
Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord and a witness from Him recites it and before it is the Book of Musa a guide and a mercy These believe in it and whoever of the different parties disbelieves in it surely it is the truth from your Lord but most men do not believe
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah
These shall be brought before their Lord and the witnesses shall say These are they who lied against their Lord
Now surely the curse of Allah is on the unjust
Who turn away from the path of Allah and desire to make it crooked and they are disbelievers in the hereafter
These shall not escape in the earth nor shall they have any guardians besides Allah the punishment shall be doubled for them they could not bear to hear and they did not see
These are they who have lost their souls and what they forged is gone from them
Truly in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
Surely as to those who believe and do good and humble themselves to their Lord these are the dwellers of the garden in it they will abide
The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing are they equal in condition
Will you not then mind
And certainly We sent Nuh to his people Surely I am a plain warner for you
That you shall not serve any but Allah surely I fear for you the punishment of a painful day
But the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said We do not consider you but a mortal like ourselves and we do not see any have followed you but those who are the meanest of us at first thought and we do not see in you any excellence over us nay we deem you liars
He said O my people tell me if I have with me clear proof from my Lord and He has granted me mercy from Himself and it has been made obscure to you shall we constrain you to accept it while you are averse from it
And O my people I ask you not for wealth in return for it my reward is only with Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe surely they shall meet their Lord but I consider you a people who are ignorant
And O my people who will help me against Allah if I drive them away
Will you not then mind
And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah and I do not know the unseen nor do I say that I am an angel nor do I say about those whom your eyes hold in mean estimation that Allah will never grant them any good Allah knows best what is in their souls for then most surely I should be of the unjust
They said O Nuh indeed you have disputed with us and lengthened dispute with us therefore bring to us what you threaten us with if you are of the truthful ones
He said Allah only will bring it to you if He please and you will not escape
And if I intend to give you good advice my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you to go astray He is your Lord and to Him shall you be returned
Or do they say He has forged it
Say If I have forged it on me is my guilt and I am clear of that of which you are guilty
And it was revealed to Nuh That none of your people will believe except those who have already believed therefore do not grieve at what they do
And make the ark before Our eyes and according to Our revelation and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust surely they shall be drowned
And he began to make the ark and whenever the chiefs from among his people passed by him they laughed at him
He said If you laugh at us surely we too laugh at you as you laugh at us
So shall you know who it is on whom will come a chastisement which will disgrace him and on whom will lasting chastisement come down
Until when Our command came and water came forth from the valley We said Carry in it two of all things a pair and your own family except those against whom the word has already gone forth and those who believe
And there believed not with him but a few
And he said Embark in it in the name of Allah be its sailing and its anchoring most surely my Lord is Forgiving Merciful
And it moved on with them amid waves like mountains and Nuh called out to his son and he was aloof O my son embark with us and be not with the unbelievers
He said I will betake myself for refuge to a mountain that shall protect me from the water
Nuh said There is no protector today from Allah s punishment but He Who has mercy and a wave intervened between them so he was of the drowned
And it was said O earth swallow down your water and O cloud clear away and the water was made to abate and the affair was decided and the ark rested on the Judi and it was said Away with the unjust people
And Nuh cried out to his Lord and said My Lord surely my son is of my family and Thy promise is surely true and Thou art the most just of the judges
He said O Nuh surely he is not of your family surely he is the doer of other than good deeds therefore ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge surely I admonish you lest you may be of the ignorant
He said My Lord
I seek refuge in Thee from asking Thee that of which I have no knowledge and if Thou shouldst not forgive me and have mercy on me I should be of the losers
It was said O Nuh descend with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people from among those who are with you and there shall be nations whom We will afford provisions then a painful punishment from Us shall afflict them
These are announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you you did not know them neither you nor your people before this therefore be patient surely the end is for those who guard against evil
And to Ad We sent their brother Hud He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than He you are nothing but forgers of lies
O my people
I do not ask of you any reward for it my reward is only with Him Who created me do you not then understand
And O my people ask forgiveness of your Lord then turn to Him He will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of rain and add strength to your strength and do not turn back guilty
They said O Hud you have not brought to us any clear argument and we are not going to desert our gods for your word and we are not believers in you
We cannot say aught but that some of our gods have smitten you with evil
He said Surely I call Allah to witness and do you bear witness too that I am clear of what you associate with Allah
Besides Him therefore scheme against me all together then give me no respite
Surely I rely on Allah my Lord and your Lord there is no living creature but He holds it by its forelock surely my Lord is on the right path
But if you turn back then indeed I have delivered to you the message with which I have been sent to you and my Lord will bring another people in your place and you cannot do Him any harm surely my Lord is the Preserver of all things
And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Hud and those who believed with him with mercy from Us and We delivered them from a hard chastisement
And this was Ad they denied the communications of their Lord and disobeyed His apostles and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer of truth
And they were overtaken by curse in this world and on the resurrection day now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord now surely away with Ad the people of Hud
And to Samood We sent their brother Salih He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than He He brought you into being from the earth and made you dwell in it therefore ask forgiveness of Him then turn to Him surely my Lord is Nigh Answering
They said O Salih surely you were one amongst us in whom great expectations were placed before this do you now forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped
And as to that which you call us to most surely we are in disquieting doubt
He said O my people tell me if I have clear proof from my Lord and He has granted to me mercy from Himself who will then help me against Allah if I disobey Him
Therefore you do not add to me other than loss
And O my people this will be as Allah s shecamel for you a sign therefore leave her to pasture on Allah s earth and do not touch her with evil for then a near chastisement will overtake you
But they slew her so he said Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days that is a promise not to be belied
So when Our decree came to pass We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by mercy from Us and We saved them from the disgrace of that day surely your Lord is the Strong the Mighty
And the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes
As though they had never dwelt in them now surely did Samood disbelieve in their Lord now surely away with Samood
And certainly Our apostles came to Ibrahim with good news They said Peace
Peace said he and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf
But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it he deemed them strange and conceived fear of them
They said Fear not surely we are sent to Lut s people
And his wife was standing by so she laughed then We gave her the good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq of a son s son Yaqoub
She said O wonder shall I bear a son when I am an extremely old woman and this my husband an extremely old man
Most surely this is a wonderful thing
They said Do you wonder at Allah s bidding The mercy of Allah and His blessings are on you O people of the house surely He is Praised Glorious
So when fear had gone away from Ibrahim and good news came to him he began to plead with Us for Lut s people
Most surely Ibrahim was forbearing tenderhearted oftreturning to Allah
O Ibrahim leave off this surely the decree of your Lord has come to pass and surely there must come to them a chastisement that cannot be averted
And when Our apostles came to Lut he was grieved for them and he lacked strength to protect them and said This is a hard day
And his people came to him as if rushed on towards him and already they did evil deeds He said O my people these are my daughters they are purer for you so guard against the punishment of Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests is there not among you one rightminded man
They said Certainly you know that we have no claim on your daughters and most surely you know what we desire
He said Ah that I had power to suppress you rather I shall have recourse to a strong support
They said O Lut we are the apostles of your Lord they shall by no means reach you so remove your followers in a part of the night and let none of you turn back except your wife for surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall her surely their appointed time is the morning is not the morning nigh
So when Our decree came to pass We turned them upside down and rained down upon them stones of what had been decreed one after another
Marked for punishment with your Lord and it is not far off from the unjust
And to Madyan We sent their brother Shu aib He said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than He and do not give short measure and weight surely I see you in prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an allencompassing day
And O my people give full measure and weight fairly and defraud not men their things and do not act corruptly in the land making mischief
What remains with Allah is better for you if you are believers and I am not a keeper over you
They said O Shu aib does your prayer enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property
Forsooth you are the forbearing the rightdirecting one
He said O my people have you considered if I have a clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself and I do not desire that in opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I forbid you I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able and with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn
And O my people let not opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of Nuh or the people of Hud or the people of Salih nor are the people of Lut far off from you
And ask forgiveness of your Lord then turn to Him surely my Lord is Merciful Lovingkind
They said O Shu aib we do not understand much of what you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us and were it not for your family we would surely stone you and you are not mighty against us
He said O my people is my family more esteemed by you than Allah
And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your back surely my Lord encompasses what you do
And O my people act according to your ability I too am acting you will come to know soon who it is on whom will light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is that is a liar and watch surely I too am watching with you
And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu aib and those who believed with him by mercy from Us and the rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became motionless bodies in their abodes
As though they had never dwelt in them now surely perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood
And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a clear authority
To Firon and his chiefs but they followed the bidding of Firon and Firon s bidding was not rightdirecting
He shall lead his people on the resurrection day and bring them down to the fire and evil the place to which they are brought
And they are overtaken by curse in this world and on the resurrection day evil the gift which shall be given
This is an account of the fate of the towns which We relate to you of them are some that stand and others mown down
And We did not do them injustice but they were unjust to themselves so their gods whom they called upon besides Allah did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord came to pass and they added but to their ruin
And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are unjust surely His punishment is painful severe
Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the chastisement of the hereafter this is a day on which the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that shall be witnessed
And We do not delay it but to an appointed term
On the day when it shall come no soul shall speak except with His permission then some of them shall be unhappy and others happy
So as to those who are unhappy they shall be in the fire for them shall be sighing and groaning in it
Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure except as your Lord please surely your Lord is the mighty doer of what He intends
And as to those who are made happy they shall be in the garden abiding in it as long as the heavens and the earth endure except as your Lord please a gift which shall never be cut off
Therefore be not in doubt as to what these worship they do not worship but as their fathers worshipped before and most surely We will pay them back in full their portion undiminished
And certainly We gave the book to Musa but it was gone against and had not a word gone forth from your Lord the matter would surely have been decided between them and surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it
And your Lord will most surely pay back to all their deeds in full surely He is aware of what they do
Continue then in the right way as you are commanded as also he who has turned to Allah with you and be not inordinate O men surely He sees what you do
And do not incline to those who are unjust lest the fire touch you and you have no guardians besides Allah then you shall not be helped
And keep up prayer in the two parts of the day and in the first hours of the night surely good deeds take away evil deeds this is a reminder to the mindful
And be patient for surely Allah does not waste the reward of the gooddoers
But why were there not among the generations before you those possessing understanding who should have forbidden the making of mischief in the earth except a few of those whom We delivered from among them
And those who were unjust went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty and they were guilty
And it did not beseem your Lord to have destroyed the towns tyrannously while their people acted well
And if your Lord had pleased He would certainly have made people a single nation and they shall continue to differ
Except those on whom your Lord has mercy and for this did He create them and the word of your Lord is fulfilled Certainly I will fill hell with the jinn and the men all together
And all we relate to you of the accounts of the apostles is to strengthen your heart therewith and in this has come to you the truth and an admonition and a reminder to the believers
And say to those who do not believe Act according to your state surely we too are acting
And wait surely we are waiting also
And Allah s is the unseen in the heavens and the earth and to Him is returned the whole of the affair therefore serve Him and rely on Him and your Lord is not heedless of what you do
Alif Lam Ra
These are the verses of the Book that makes things manifest
Surely We have revealed it an Arabic Quran that you may understand
We narrate to you the best of narratives by Our revealing to you this Quran though before this you were certainly one of those who did not know
When Yusuf said to his father O my father surely I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon I saw them making obeisance to me
He said O my son do not relate your vision to your brothers lest they devise a plan against you surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man
And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of sayings and make His favor complete to you and to the children of Yaqoub as He made it complete before to your fathers Ibrahim and Ishaq surely your Lord is Knowing Wise
Certainly in Yusuf and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers
When they said Certainly Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are a stronger company most surely our father is in manifest error
Slay Yusuf or cast him forth into some land so that your father s regard may be exclusively for you and after that you may be a righteous people
A speaker from among them said Do not slay Yusuf and cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do it so that some of the travellers may pick him up
They said O our father what reason have you that you do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf And most surely we are his sincere wellwishers
Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and sport and surely we will guard him well
He said Surely it grieves me that you should take him off and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are heedless of him
They said Surely if the wolf should devour him notwithstanding that we are a strong company we should then certainly be losers
So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of the pit and We revealed to him You will most certainly inform them of this their affair while they do not perceive
And they came to their father at nightfall weeping
They said O our father surely we went off racing and left Yusuf by our goods so the wolf devoured him and you will not believe us though we are truthful
And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it
He said Nay your souls have made the matter light for you but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is sought for against what you describe
And there came travellers and they sent their waterdrawer and he let down his bucket He said O good news this is a youth and they concealed him as an article of merchandise and Allah knew what they did
And they sold him for a small price a few pieces of silver and they showed no desire for him
And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife Give him an honorable abode maybe he will be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son
And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings and Allah is the master of His affair but most people do not know
And when he had attained his maturity We gave him wisdom and knowledge and thus do We reward those who do good
And she in whose house he was sought to make himself yield to her and she made fast the doors and said Come forward He said I seek Allah s refuge surely my Lord made good my abode Surely the unjust do not prosper
And certainly she made for him and he would have made for her were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence of his Lord thus it was that We might turn away from him evil and indecency surely he was one of Our sincere servants
And they both hastened to the door and she rent his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door
She said What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement
He said She sought to make me yield to her and a witness of her own family bore witness If his shirt is rent from front she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars
And if his shirt is rent from behind she tells a lie and he is one of the truthful
So when he saw his shirt rent from behind he said Surely it is a guile of you women surely your guile is great
O Yusuf turn aside from this and O my wife ask forgiveness for your fault surely you are one of the wrongdoers
And women in the city said The chiefs wife seeks her slave to yield himself to her surely he has affected her deeply with his love most surely we see her in manifest error
So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them and prepared for them a repast and gave each of them a knife and said to Yusuf Come forth to them So when they saw him they deemed him great and cut their hands in amazement and said Remote is Allah from imperfection this is not a mortal this is but a noble angel
She said This is he with respect to whom you blamed me and certainly I sought his yielding himself to me but he abstained and if he does not do what I bid him he shall certainly be imprisoned and he shall certainly be of those who are in a state of ignominy
He said My Lord the prison house is dearer to me than that to which they invite me and if Thou turn not away their device from me I will yearn towards them and become one of the ignorant
Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their guile from him surely He is the Hearing the Knowing
Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him till a time
And two youths entered the prison with him
One of them said I saw myself pressing wine
And the other said I saw myself carrying bread on my head of which birds ate
Inform us of its interpretation surely we see you to be of the doers of good
He said There shall not come to you the food with which you are fed but I will inform you both of its interpretation before it comes to you this is of what my Lord has taught me surely I have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah and they are deniers of the hereafter
And I follow the religion of my fathers Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub it beseems us not that we should associate aught with Allah this is by Allah s grace upon us and on mankind but most people do not give thanks
O my two mates of the prison are sundry lords better or Allah the One the Supreme
You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named you and your fathers Allah has not sent down any authority for them judgment is only Allah s He has commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him this is the right religion but most people do not know
O my two mates of the prison as for one of you he shall give his lord to drink wine and as for the other he shall be crucified so that the birds shall eat from his head the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired
And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two Remember me with your lord but the Shaitan caused him to forget mentioning it to his lord so he remained in the prison a few years
And the king said Surely I see seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured and seven green ears and seven others dry O chiefs explain to me my dream if you can interpret the dream
They said Confused dreams and we do not know the interpretation of dreams
And of the two prisoners he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said I will inform you of its interpretation so let me go
Yusuf O truthful one explain to us seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured and seven green ears and seven others dry that I may go back to the people so that they may know
He said You shall sow for seven years continuously then what you reap leave it in its ear except a little of which you eat
Then there shall come after that seven years of hardship which shall eat away all that you have beforehand laid up in store for them except a little of what you shall have preserved
Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall press grapes
And the king said Bring him to me
So when the messenger came to him he said Go back to your lord and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands surely my Lord knows their guile
He said How was your affair when you sought Yusuf to yield himself to you
They said Remote is Allah from imperfection we knew of no evil on his part
The chief s wife said Now has the truth become established I sought him to yield himself to me and he is most surely of the truthful ones
This is that he might know that I have not been unfaithful to him in secret and that Allah does not guide the device of the unfaithful
And I do not declare myself free most surely man s self is wont to command him to do evil except such as my Lord has had mercy on surely my Lord is Forgiving Merciful
And the king said Bring him to me I will choose him for myself
So when he had spoken with him he said Surely you are in our presence today an honorable a faithful one
He said Place me in authority over the treasures of the land surely I am a good keeper knowing well
And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land he had mastery in it wherever he liked We send down Our mercy on whom We please and We do not waste the reward of those who do good
And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better for those who believe and guard against evil
And Yusuf s brothers came and went in to him and he knew them while they did not recognize him
And when he furnished them with their provision he said Bring to me a brother of yours from your father do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of hosts
But if you do not bring him to me you shall have no measure of corn from me nor shall you come near me
They said We will strive to make his father yield in respect of him and we are sure to do it
And he said to his servants Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their family so that they may come back
So when they returned to their father they said O our father the measure is withheld from us therefore send with us our brother so that we may get the measure and we will most surely guard him
He said I cannot trust in you with respect to him except as I trusted in you with respect to his brother before but Allah is the best Keeper and He is the most Merciful of the merciful ones
And when they opened their goods they found their money returned to them
They said O our father what more can we desire
This is our property returned to us and we will bring corn for our family and guard our brother and will have in addition the measure of a camel load this is an easy measure
He said I will by no means send him with you until you give me a firm covenant in Allah s name that you will most certainly bring him back to me unless you are completely surrounded
And when they gave him their covenant he said Allah is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we say
And he said O my sons do not all enter by one gate and enter by different gates and I cannot avail you aught against Allah judgment is only Allah s on Him do I rely and on Him let those who are reliant rely
And when they had entered as their father had bidden them it did not avail them aught against Allah but it was only a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge but most people do not know
And when they went in to Yusuf he lodged his brother with himself saying I am your brother therefore grieve not at what they do
So when he furnished them with their provisions someone placed the drinking cup in his brother s bag
Then a crier cried out O caravan you are most surely thieves
They said while they were facing them What is it that you miss
They said We miss the king s drinking cup and he who shall bring it shall have a camelload and I am responsible for it
They said By Allah you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land and we are not thieves
They said But what shall be the requital of this if you are liars
They said The requital of this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself be held for the satisfaction thereof thus do we punish the wrongdoers
So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother then he brought it out from his brother s sack Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf it was not lawful that he should take his brother under the king s law unless Allah pleased We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please and above every one possessed of knowledge is the Allknowing one
They said If he steal a brother of his did indeed steal before but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did not disclose it to them
He said You are in an evil condition and Allah knows best what you state
They said O chief he has a father a very old man therefore retain one of us in his stead surely we see you to be of the doers of good
He said Allah protect us that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property for then most surely we would be unjust
Then when they despaired of him they retired conferring privately together
The eldest of them said Do you not know that your father took from you a covenant in Allah s name and how you fell short of your duty with respect to Yusuf before
Therefore I will by no means depart from this land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me and He is the best of the judges
Go back to your father and say O our father surely your son committed theft and we do not bear witness except to what we have known and we could not keep watch over the unseen
And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan with which we proceeded and most surely we are truthful
He Yaqoub said Nay your souls have made a matter light for you so patience is good maybe Allah will bring them all together to me surely He is the Knowing the Wise
And he turned away from them and said O my sorrow for Yusuf and his eyes became white on account of the grief and he was a repressor of grief
They said By Allah you will not cease to remember Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or until you are of those who perish
He said I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah and I know from Allah what you do not know
O my sons
Go and inquire respecting Yusuf and his brother and despair not of Allah s mercy surely none despairs of Allah s mercy except the unbelieving people
So when they came in to him they said O chief distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought scanty money so give us full measure and be charitable to us surely Allah rewards the charitable
He said Do you know how you treated Yusuf and his brother when you were ignorant
They said Are you indeed Yusuf
He said I am Yusuf and this is my brother Allah has indeed been gracious to us surely he who guards against evil and is patient is rewarded for surely Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good
They said By Allah now has Allah certainly chosen you over us and we were certainly sinners
He said There shall be no reproof against you this day Allah may forgive you and He is the most Merciful of the merciful
Take this my shirt and cast it on my father s face he will again be able to see and come to me with all your families
And when the caravan had departed their father said Most surely I perceive the greatness of Yusuf unless you pronounce me to be weak in judgment
They said By Allah you are most surely in your old error
So when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his face so forthwith he regained his sight He said Did I not say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know
They said O our father ask forgiveness of our faults for us surely we were sinners
He said I will ask for you forgiveness from my Lord surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Then when they came in to Yusuf he took his parents to lodge with him and said Enter safe into Egypt if Allah please
And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell down in prostration before him and he said O my father this is the significance of my vision of old my Lord has indeed made it to be true and He was indeed kind to me when He brought me forth from the prison and brought you from the desert after the Shaitan had sown dissensions between me and my brothers surely my Lord is benignant to whom He pleases surely He is the Knowing the Wise
My Lord Thou hast given me of the kingdom and taught me of the interpretation of sayings Originator of the heavens and the earth Thou art my guardian in this world and the hereafter make me die a muslim and join me with the good
This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We reveal to you and you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair and they were devising plans
And most men will not believe though you desire it eagerly
And you do not ask them for a reward for this it is nothing but a reminder for all mankind
And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth which they pass by yet they turn aside from it
And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him
Do they then feel secure that there may come to them an extensive chastisement from Allah or that the hour may come to them suddenly while they do not perceive
Say This is my way I call to Allah I and those who follow me being certain and glory be to Allah and I am not one of the polytheists
And We have not sent before you but men from among the people of the towns to whom We sent revelations
Have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
And certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who guard against evil do you not then understand
Until when the apostles despaired and the people became sure that they were indeed told a lie Our help came to them and whom We pleased was delivered and Our punishment is not averted from the guilty people
In their histories there is certainly a lesson for men of understanding
It is not a narrative which could be forged but a verification of what is before it and a distinct explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe
Alif Lam Mim Ra
These are the verses of the Book and that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth but most people do not believe
Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see and He is firm in power and He made the sun and the moon subservient to you each one pursues its course to an appointed time He regulates the affair making clear the signs that you may be certain of meeting your Lord
And He it is Who spread the earth and made in it firm mountains and rivers and of all fruits He has made in it two kinds He makes the night cover the day most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect
And in the earth there are tracts side by side and gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees having one root and others having distinct roots they are watered with one water and We make some of them excel others in fruit most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand
And if you would wonder then wondrous is their saying What when we are dust shall we then certainly be in a new creation These are they who disbelieve in their Lord and these have chains on their necks and they are the inmates of the fire in it they shall abide
And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them and most surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness to people notwithstanding their injustice and most surely your Lord is severe in requiting evil
And those who disbelieve say Why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his Lord
You are only a warner and there is a guide for every people
Allah knows what every female bears and that of which the wombs fall short of completion and that in which they increase and there is a measure with Him of everything
The knower of the unseen and the seen the Great the Most High
Alike to Him among you is he who conceals his words and he who speaks them openly and he who hides himself by night and who goes forth by day
For his sake there are angels following one another before him and behind him who guard him by Allah s commandment surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition and when Allah intends evil to a people there is no averting it and besides Him they have no protector
He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and hope and Who brings up the heavy cloud
And the thunder declares His glory with His praise and the angels too for awe of Him and He sends the thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases yet they dispute concerning Allah and He is mighty in prowess
To Him is due the true prayer and those whom they pray to besides Allah give them no answer but they are like one who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach his mouth but it will not reach it and the prayer of the unbelievers is only in error
And whoever is in the heavens and the earth makes obeisance to Allah only willingly and unwillingly and their shadows too at morn and eve
Say Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth Say Allah
Say Do you take then besides Him guardians who do not control any profit or harm for themselves Say Are the blind and the seeing alike
Or can the darkness and the light be equal
Or have they set up with Allah associates who have created creation like His so that what is created became confused to them
Say Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the One the Supreme
He sends down water from the cloud then watercourses flow with water according to their measure and the torrent bears along the swelling foam and from what they melt in the fire for the sake of making ornaments or apparatus arises a scum like it thus does Allah compare truth and falsehood then as for the scum it passes away as a worthless thing and as for that which profits the people it tarries in the earth thus does Allah set forth parables
For those who respond to their Lord is good and as for those who do not respond to Him had they all that is in the earth and the like thereof with it they would certainly offer it for a ransom As for those an evil reckoning shall be theirs and their abode is hell and evil is the restingplace
Is he then who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like him who is blind
Only those possessed of understanding will mind
Those who fulfil the promise of Allah and do not break the covenant
And those who join that which Allah has bidden to be joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil reckoning
And those who are constant seeking the pleasure of their Lord and keep up prayer and spend benevolently out of what We have given them secretly and openly and repel evil with good as for those they shall have the happy issue of the abode
The gardens of perpetual abode which they will enter along with those who do good from among their parents and their spouses and their offspring and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate
Peace be on you because you were constant how excellent is then the issue of the abode
And those who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut asunder that which Allah has ordered to be joined and make mischief in the land as for those upon them shall be curse and they shall have the evil issue of the abode
Allah amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and they rejoice in this world s life and this world s life is nothing compared with the hereafter but a temporary enjoyment
And those who disbelieve say Why is not a sign sent down upon him by his Lord
Say Surely Allah makes him who will go astray and guides to Himself those who turn to Him
Those who believe and whose hearts are set at rest by the remembrance of Allah now surely by Allah s remembrance are the hearts set at rest
As for those who believe and do good a good final state shall be theirs and a goodly return
And thus We have sent you among a nation before which other nations have passed away that you might recite to them what We have revealed to you and still they deny the Beneficent Allah Say He is my Lord there is no god but He on Him do I rely and to Him is my return
And even if there were a Quran with which the mountains were made to pass away or the earth were travelled over with it or the dead were made to speak thereby nay the commandment is wholly Allah s Have not yet those who believe known that if Allah please He would certainly guide all the people And as for those who disbelieve there will not cease to afflict them because of what they do a repelling calamity or it will alight close by their abodes until the promise of Allah comes about surely Allah will not fail in His promise
And apostles before you were certainly mocked at but I gave respite to those who disbelieved then I destroyed them how then was My requital of evil
Is He then Who watches every soul as to what it earns And yet they give associates to Allah Say Give them a name nay do you mean to inform Him of what He does not know in the earth or do you affirm this by an outward saying Rather their plans are made to appear fairseeming to those who disbelieve and they are kept back from the path and whom Allah makes err he shall have no guide
They shall have chastisement in this world s life and the chastisement of the hereafter is certainly more grievous and they shall have no protector against Allah
A likeness of the garden which the righteous are promised there now beneath it rivers its food and shades are perpetual this is the requital of those who guarded against evil and the requital of the unbelievers is the fire
And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in that which has been revealed to you and of the confederates are some who deny a part of it Say I am only commanded that I should serve Allah and not associate anything with Him to Him do I invite you and to Him is my return
And thus have We revealed it a true judgment in Arabic and if you follow their low desires after what has come to you of knowledge you shall not have against Allah any guardian or a protector
And certainly We sent apostles before you and gave them wives and children and it is not in the power of an apostle to bring a sign except by Allah s permission for every term there is an appointment
Allah makes to pass away and establishes what He pleases and with Him is the basis of the Book
And We will either let you see part of what We threaten them with or cause you to die for only the delivery of the message is incumbent on you while calling them to account is Our business
Do they not see that We are bringing destruction upon the land by curtailing it of its sides
And Allah pronounces a doom there is no repeller of His decree and He is swift to take account
And those before them did indeed make plans but all planning is Allah s He knows what every soul earns and the unbelievers shall come to know for whom is the better issue of the abode
And those who disbelieve say You are not a messenger
Say Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the Book
Alif Lam Ra
This is a Book which We have revealed to you that you may bring forth men by their Lord s permission from utter darkness into light to the way of the Mighty the Praised One
Of Allah Whose is whatever is in the heavens and whatever Is in the earth and woe to the unbelievers on account of the severe chastisement
To those who love this world s life more than the hereafter and turn away from Allah s path and desire to make it crooked these are in a great error
And We did not send any apostle but with the language of his people so that he might explain to them clearly then Allah makes whom He pleases err and He guides whom He pleases and He is the Mighty the Wise
And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications saying Bring forth your people from utter darkness into light and remind them of the days of Allah most surely there are signs in this for every patient grateful one
And when Musa said to his people Call to mind Allah s favor to you when He delivered you from Firon s people who subjected you to severe torment and slew your sons and spared your women and in this there was a great trial from your Lord
And when your Lord made it known If you are grateful I would certainly give to you more and if you are ungrateful My chastisement is truly severe
And Musa said If you are ungrateful you and those on earth all together most surely Allah is Selfsufficient Praised
Has not the account reached you of those before you of the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood and those after them
None knows them but Allah
Their apostles come to them with clear arguments but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said Surely we deny that with which you are sent and most surely we are in serious doubt as to that to which you invite us
Their apostles said Is there doubt about Allah the Maker of the heavens and the earth
He invites you to forgive you your faults and to respite you till an appointed term
They said You are nothing but mortals like us you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship bring us therefore some clear authority
Their apostles said to them We are nothing but mortals like yourselves but Allah bestows His favors on whom He pleases of His servants and it is not for us that we should bring you an authority except by Allah s permission and on Allah should the believers rely
And what reason have we that we should not rely on Allah
And He has indeed guided us in our ways and certainly we would bear with patience your persecution of us and on Allah should the reliant rely
And those who disbelieved said to their apostles We will most certainly drive you forth from our land or else you shall come back into our religion
So their Lord revealed to them Most certainly We will destroy the unjust
And most certainly We will settle you in the land after them this is for him who fears standing in My presence and who fears My threat
And they asked for judgment and every insolent opposer was disappointed
Hell is before him and he shall be given to drink of festering water
He will drink it little by little and will not be able to swallow it agreeably and death will come to him from every quarter but he shall not die and there shall be vehement chastisement before him
The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord their actions are like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day they shall not have power over any thing out of what they have earned this is the great error
Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth
If He please He will take you off and bring a new creation
And this is not difficult for Allah
And they shall all come forth before Allah then the weak shall say to those who were proud Surely we were your followers can you therefore avert from us any part of the chastisement of Allah They would say If Allah had guided us we too would have guided you it is the same to us whether we are impatient now or patient there is no place for us to fly to
And the Shaitan shall say after the affair is decided Surely Allah promised you the promise of truth and I gave you promises then failed to keep them to you and I had no authority over you except that I called you and you obeyed me therefore do not blame me but blame yourselves I cannot be your aider now nor can you be my aiders surely I disbelieved in your associating me with Allah before surely it is the unjust that shall have the painful punishment
And those who believe and do good are made to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide in them by their Lord s permission their greeting therein is Peace
Have you not considered how Allah sets forth a parable of a good word being like a good tree whose root is firm and whose branches are in heaven
Yielding its fruit in every season by the permission of its Lord
And Allah sets forth parables for men that they may be mindful
And the parable of an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth s surface it has no stability
Allah confirms those who believe with the sure word in this world s life and in the hereafter and Allah causes the unjust to go astray and Allah does what He pleases
Have you not seen those who have changed Allah s favor for ungratefulness and made their people to alight into the abode of perdition
Into j hell
They shall enter into it and an evil place it is to settle in
And they set up equals with Allah that they may lead people astray from His path
Say Enjoy yourselves for surely your return is to the fire
Say to My servants who believe that they should keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly before the coming of the day in which there shall be no bartering nor mutual befriending
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the clouds then brought forth with it fruits as a sustenance for you and He has made the ships subservient to you that they might run their course in the sea by His command and He has made the rivers subservient to you
And He has made subservient to you the sun and the moon pursuing their courses and He has made subservient to you the night and the day
And He gives you of all that you ask Him and if you count Allah s favors you will not be able to number them most surely man is very unjust very ungrateful
And when Ibrahim said My Lord make this city secure and save me and my sons from worshipping idols
My Lord surely they have led many men astray then whoever follows me he is surely of me and whoever disobeys me Thou surely art Forgiving Merciful
O our Lord surely I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy Sacred House our Lord that they may keep up prayer therefore make the hearts of some people yearn towards them and provide them with fruits haply they may be grateful
O our Lord
Surely Thou knowest what we hide and what we make public and nothing in the earth nor any thing in heaven is hidden from Allah
Praise be to Allah Who has given me in old age Ismail and Ishaq most surely my Lord is the Hearer of prayer
My Lord make me keep up prayer and from my offspring too O our Lord and accept my prayer
O our Lord grant me protection and my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning shall come to pass
And do not think Allah to be heedless of what the unjust do He only respites them to a day on which the eyes shall be fixedly open
Hastening forward their heads upraised their eyes not reverting to them and their hearts vacant
And warn people of the day when the chastisement shall come to them then those who were unjust will say O our Lord respite us to a near term so we shall respond to Thy call and follow the apostles What did you not swear before that there will be no passing away for you
And you dwell in the abodes of those who were unjust to themselves and it is clear to you how We dealt with them and We have made them examples to you
And they have indeed planned their plan but their plan is with Allah though their plan was such that the mountains should pass away thereby
Therefore do not think Allah to be one failing in His promise to His apostles surely Allah is Mighty the Lord of Retribution
On the day when the earth shall be changed into a different earth and the heavens as well and they shall come forth before Allah the One the Supreme
And you will see the guilty on that day linked together in chains
Their shirts made of pitch and the fire covering their faces
That Allah may requite each soul according to what it has earned surely Allah is swift in reckoning
This is a sufficient exposition for the people and that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is One Allah and that those possessed of understanding may mind
Alif Lam Ra
These are the verses of the Book and of a Quran that makes things clear
Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been Muslims
Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and that hope may beguile them for they will soon know
And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made known
No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone it
And they say O you to whom the Reminder has been revealed you are most surely insane
Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the truthful ones
We do not send the angels but with truth and then they would not be respited
Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most surely be its guardian
And certainly We sent apostles before you among the nations of yore
And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked him
Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the guilty
They do not believe in it and indeed the example of the former people has already passed
And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven so that they ascend into it all the while
They would certainly say Only our eyes have been covered over rather we are an enchanted people
And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and We have made it fair seeming to the beholders
And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan
But he who steals a hearing so there follows him a visible flame
And the earth We have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing
And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for him for whom you are not the suppliers
And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures of it and We do not send it down but in a known measure
And We send the winds fertilizing then send down water from the cloud so We give it to you to drink of nor is it you who store it up
And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We are the heirs
And certainly We know those of you who have gone before and We certainly know those who shall come later
And surely your Lord will gather them together surely He is Wise Knowing
And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth sound of black mud fashioned in shape
And the jinn We created before of intensely hot fire
And when your Lord said to the angels Surely I am going to create a mortal of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape
So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit fall down making obeisance to him
So the angels made obeisance all of them together
But Iblis did it not he refused to be with those who made obeisance
He said O Iblis what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance
He said I am not such that I should make obeisance to a mortal whom Thou hast created of the essence of black mud fashioned in shape
He said Then get out of it for surely you are driven away
And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment
He said My Lord then respite me till the time when they are raised
He said So surely you are of the respited ones
Till the period of the time made known
He said My Lord because Thou hast made life evil to me I will certainly make evil fairseeming to them on earth and I will certainly cause them all to deviate
Except Thy servants from among them the devoted ones
He said This is a right way with Me
Surely as regards My servants you have no authority over them except those who follow you of the deviators
And surely Hell is the promised place of them all
It has seven gates for every gate there shall be a separate party of them
Surely those who guard against evil shall be in the midst of gardens and fountains
Enter them in peace secure
And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their breasts they shall be as brethren on raised couches face to face
Toil shall not afflict them in it nor shall they be ever ejected from it
Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving the Merciful
And that My punishment that is the painful punishment
And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim
When they entered upon him they said Peace
He said Surely we are afraid of you
They said Be not afraid surely we give you the good news of a boy possessing knowledge
He said Do you give me good news of a son when old age has come upon me Of what then do you give me good news
They said We give you good news with truth therefore be not of the despairing
He said And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but the erring ones
He said What is your business then O apostles
They said Surely we are sent towards a guilty people
Except Lut s followers We will most surely deliver them all
Except his wife We ordained that she shall surely be of those who remain behind
So when the apostles came to Lut s followers
He said Surely you are an unknown people
They said Nay we have come to you with that about which they disputed
And we have come to you with the truth and we are most surely truthful
Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the night and yourself follow their rear and let not any one of you turn round and go forth whither you are commanded
And We revealed to him this decree that the roots of these shall be cut off in the morning
And the people of the town came rejoicing
He said Surely these are my guests therefore do not disgrace me
And guard against the punishment of Allah and do not put me to shame
They said Have we not forbidden you from other people
He said These are my daughters if you will do aught
By your life they were blindly wandering on in their intoxication
So the rumbling overtook them while entering upon the time of sunrise
Thus did We turn it upside down and rained down upon them stones of what had been decreed
Surely in this are signs for those who examine
And surely it is on a road that still abides
Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers
And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely unjust
So We inflicted retribution on them and they are both indeed on an open road still pursued
And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the apostles
And We gave them Our communications but they turned aside from them
And they hewed houses in the mountains in security
So the rumbling overtook them in the morning
And what they earned did not avail them
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but in truth and the hour is most surely coming so turn away with kindly forgiveness
Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things the Knowing
And certainly We have given you seven of the oftrepeated verses and the grand Quran
Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain classes of them to enjoy and do not grieve for them and make yourself gentle to the believers
And say Surely I am the plain warner
Like as We sent down on the dividers
Those who made the Quran into shreds
So by your Lord We would most certainly question them all
As to what they did
Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn aside from the polytheists
Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers
Those who set up another god with Allah so they shall soon know
And surely We know that your breast straitens at what they say
Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord and be of those who make obeisance
And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which is certain
Allah s commandment has come therefore do not desire to hasten it glory be to Him and highly exalted be He above what they associate with Him
He sends down the angels with the inspiration by His commandment on whom He pleases of His servants saying Give the warning that there is no god but Me therefore be careful of your duty to Me
He created the heavens and the earth with the truth highly exalted be He above what they associate with Him
He created man from a small seed and lo he is an open contender
And He created the cattle for you you have in them warm clothing and many advantages and of them do you eat
And there is beauty in them for you when you drive them back to home and when you send them forth to pasture
And they carry your heavy loads to regions which you could not reach but with distress of the souls most surely your Lord is Compassionate Merciful
And He made horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them and as an ornament and He creates what you do not know
And upon Allah it rests to show the right way and there are some deviating ways and if He please He would certainly guide you all aright
He it is Who sends down water from the cloud for you it gives drink and by it grow the trees upon which you pasture
He causes to grow for you thereby herbage and the olives and the palm trees and the grapes and of all the fruits most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect
And He has made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the stars are made subservient by His commandment most surely there are signs in this for a people who ponder
And what He has created in the earth of varied hues most surely there is a sign in this for a people who are mindful
And He it is Who has made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships cleaving through it and that you might seek of His bounty and that you may give thanks
And He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with you and rivers and roads that you may go aright
And landmarks and by the stars they find the right way
Is He then Who creates like him who does not create
Do you not then mind
And if you would count Allah s favors you will not be able to number them most surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And Allah knows what you conceal and what you do openly
And those whom they call on besides Allah have not created anything while they are themselves created
Dead are they not living and they know not when they shall be raised
Your Allah is one Allah so as for those who do not believe in the hereafter their hearts are ignorant and they are proud
Truly Allah knows what they hide and what they manifest surely He does not love the proud
And when it is said to them what is it that your Lord has revealed They say Stories of the ancients
That they may bear their burdens entirely on the day of resurrection and also of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without knowledge now surely evil is what they bear
Those before them did indeed devise plans but Allah demolished their building from the foundations so the roof fell down on them from above them and the punishment came to them from whence they did not perceive
Then on the resurrection day He will bring them to disgrace and say Where are the associates you gave Me for whose sake you became hostile
Those who are given the knowledge will say Surely the disgrace and the evil are this day upon the unbelievers
Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to themselves Then would they offer submission We used not to do any evil
Therefore enter the gates of hell to abide therein so certainly evil is the dwelling place of the proud
And it is said to those who guard against evil What is it that your Lord has revealed
They say Good
For those who do good in this world is good and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better and certainly most excellent is the abode of those who guard against evil
The gardens of perpetuity they shall enter them rivers flowing beneath them they shall have in them what they please
Thus does Allah reward those who guard against evil
Those whom the angels cause to die in a good state saying Peace be on you enter the garden for what you did
They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them or that the commandment of your Lord should come to pass
Thus did those before them and Allah was not unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
So the evil consequences of what they did shall afflict them and that which they mocked shall encompass them
And they who give associates to Allah say If Allah had pleased we would not have served anything besides Allah neither we nor our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything without order from Him Thus did those before them is then aught incumbent upon the apostles except a plain delivery of the message
And certainly We raised in every nation an apostle saying Serve Allah and shun the Shaitan
So there were some of them whom Allah guided and there were others against whom error was due therefore travel in the land then see what was the end of the rejecters
If you desire for their guidance yet surely Allah does not guide him who leads astray nor shall they have any helpers
And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths Allah will not raise up him who dies
Yea it is a promise binding on Him quite true but most people do not know
So that He might make manifest to them that about which they differ and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liars
Our word for a thing when We intend it is only that We say to it Be and it is
And those who fly for Allah s sake after they are oppressed We will most certainly give them a good abode in the world and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much greater did they but know
Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely
And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation so ask the followers of the Reminder if you do not know
With clear arguments and scriptures and We have revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to men what has been revealed to them and that haply they may reflect
Do they then who plan evil deeds feel secure of this that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not perceive
Or that He may not seize them in the course of their journeys then shall they not escape
Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer gradual loss for your Lord is most surely Compassionate Merciful
Do they not consider every thing that Allah has created Its very shadows return from right and left making obeisance to Allah while they are in utter abasement
And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth makes obeisance to Allah only and the angels too and they do not show pride
They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded
And Allah has said Take not two gods He is only one Allah so of Me alone should you be afraid
And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His and to Him should obedience be rendered constantly will you then guard against other than the punishment of Allah
And whatever favor is bestowed on you it is from Allah then when evil afflicts you to Him do you cry for aid
Yet when He removes the evil from you lo a party of you associate others with their Lord
So that they be ungrateful for what We have given them then enjoy yourselves for soon will you know
And they set apart for what they do not know a portion of what We have given them
By Allah you shall most certainly be questioned about that which you forged
And they ascribe daughters to Allah glory be to Him and for themselves they would have what they desire
And when a daughter is announced to one of them his face becomes black and he is full of wrath
He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that which is announced to him
Shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it alive in the dust
Now surely evil is what they judge
For those who do not believe in the hereafter is an evil attribute and Allah s is the loftiest attribute and He is the Mighty the Wise
And if Allah had destroyed men for their iniquity He would not leave on the earth a single creature but He respites them till an appointed time so when their doom will come they shall not be able to delay it an hour nor can they bring it on before its time
And they ascribe to Allah what they themselves hate and their tongues relate the lie that they shall have the good there is no avoiding it that for them is the fire and that they shall be sent before
By Allah most certainly We sent apostles to nations before you but the Shaitan made their deeds fairseeming to them so he is their guardian today and they shall have a painful punishment
And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you may make clear to them that about which they differ and as a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
And Allah has sent down water from the cloud and therewith given life to the earth after its death most surely there is a sign in this for a people who would listen
And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle We give you to drink of what is in their bellies from betwixt the feces and the blood pure milk easy and agreeable to swallow for those who drink
And of the fruits of the palms and the grapes you obtain from them intoxication and goodly provision most surely there is a sign in this for a people who ponder
And your Lord revealed to the bee saying Make hives in the mountains and in the trees and in what they build
Then eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of your Lord submissively
There comes forth from within it a beverage of many colours in which there is healing for men most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect
And Allah has created you then He causes you to die and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of life so that after having knowledge he does not know anything surely Allah is Knowing Powerful
And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence so those who are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess so that they should be equal therein is it then the favor of Allah which they deny
And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves and has given you sons and grandchildren from your wives and has given you of the good things is it then in the falsehood that they believe while it is in the favor of Allah that they disbelieve
And they serve besides Allah that which does not control for them any sustenance at all from the heavens and the earth nor have they any power
Therefore do not give likenesses to Allah surely Allah knows and you do not know
Allah sets forth a parable consider a slave the property of another who has no power over anything and one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance so he spends from it secretly and openly are the two alike
All praise is due to Allah Nay most of them do not know
And Allah sets forth a parable of two men one of them is dumb not able to do anything and he is a burden to his master wherever he sends him he brings no good can he be held equal with him who enjoins what is just and he himself is on the right path
And Allah s is the unseen of the heavens and the earth and the matter of the hour is but as the twinkling of an eye or it is higher still surely Allah has power over all things
And Allah has brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers you did not know anything and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you may give thanks
Do they not see the birds constrained in the middle of the sky
None withholds them but Allah most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
And Allah has given you a place to abide in your houses and He has given you tents of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the day of your halting and of their wool and their fur and their hair He has given you household stuff and a provision for a time
And Allah has made for you of what He has created shelters and He has given you in the mountains places of retreat and He has given you garments to preserve you from the heat and coats of mail to preserve you in your fighting even thus does He complete His favor upon you that haply you may submit
But if they turn back then on you devolves only the clear deliverance of the message
They recognize the favor of Allah yet they deny it and most of them are ungrateful
And on the day when We will raise up a witness out of every nation then shall no permission be given to those who disbelieve nor shall they be made to solicit favor
And when those who are unjust shall see the chastisement it shall not be lightened for them nor shall they be respited
And when those who associate others with Allah shall see their associategods they shall say Our Lord these are our associategods on whom we called besides Thee
But they will give them back the reply Most surely you are liars
And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day and what they used to forge shall depart from them
As for those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah s way We will add chastisement to their chastisement because they made mischief
And on the day when We will raise up in every people a witness against them from among themselves and bring you as a witness against these and We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything and a guidance and mercy and good news for those who submit
Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing of good to others and the giving to the kindred and He forbids indecency and evil and rebellion He admonishes you that you may be mindful
And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made a covenant and do not break the oaths after making them fast and you have indeed made Allah a surety for you surely Allah knows what you do
And be not like her who unravels her yarn disintegrating it into pieces after she has spun it strongly
You make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because one nation is more numerous than another nation
Allah only tries you by this and He will most certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that about which you differed
And if Allah please He would certainly make you a single nation but He causes to err whom He pleases and guides whom He pleases and most certainly you will be questioned as to what you did
And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you lest a foot should slip after its stability and you should taste evil because you turned away from Allah s way and grievous punishment be your lot
And do not take a small price in exchange for Allah s covenant surely what is with Allah is better for you did you but know
What is with you passes away and what is with Allah is enduring and We will most certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of what they did
Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer We will most certainly make him live a happy life and We will most certainly give them their reward for the best of what they did
So when you recite the Quran seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaitan
Surely he has no authority over those who believe and rely on their Lord
His authority is only over those who befriend him and those who associate others with Him
And when We change one communication for another communication and Allah knows best what He reveals they say You are only a forger
Nay most of them do not know
Say The Holy spirit has revealed it from your Lord with the truth that it may establish those who believe and as a guidance and good news for those who submit
And certainly We know that they say Only a mortal teaches him
The tongue of him whom they reproach is barbarous and this is clear Arabic tongue
As for those who do not believe in Allah s communications surely Allah will not guide them and they shall have a painful punishment
Only they forge the lie who do not believe in Allah s communications and these are the liars
He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on account of faith but he who opens his breast to disbelief on these is the wrath of Allah and they shall have a grievous chastisement
This is because they love this world s life more than the hereafter and because Allah does not guide the unbelieving people
These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal and these are the heedless ones
No doubt that in the hereafter they will be the losers
Yet surely your Lord with respect to those who fly after they are persecuted then they struggle hard and are patient most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving Merciful
Remember the day when every soul shall come pleading for itself and every soul shall be paid in full what it has done and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
And Allah sets forth a parable Consider a town safe and secure to which its means of subsistence come in abundance from every quarter but it became ungrateful to Allah s favors therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost degree of hunger and fear because of what they wrought
And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among them but they rejected him so the punishment overtook them while they were unjust
Therefore eat of what Allah has given you lawful and good things and give thanks for Allah s favor if Him do you serve
He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that over which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked but whoever is driven to necessity not desiring nor exceeding the limit then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And for what your tongues describe do not utter the lie saying This is lawful and this is unlawful in order to forge a lie against Allah surely those who forge the lie against Allah shall not prosper
A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful punishment
And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have related to you already and We did them no injustice but they were unjust to themselves
Yet surely your Lord with respect to those who do an evil in ignorance then turn after that and make amends most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving Merciful
Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar obedient to Allah upright and he was not of the polytheists
Grateful for His favors He chose him and guided him on the right path
And We gave him good in this world and in the next he will most surely be among the good
Then We revealed to you Follow the faith of Ibrahim the upright one and he was not of the polytheists
The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed about it and most surely your Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that about which they differed
Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and have disputations with them in the best manner surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from His path and He knows best those who follow the right way
And if you take your turn then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted but if you are patient it will certainly be best for those who are patient
And be patient and your patience is not but by the assistance of Allah and grieve not for them and do not distress yourself at what they plan
Surely Allah is with those who guard against evil and those who do good to others
Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have blessed the precincts so that We may show to him some of Our signs surely He is the Hearing the Seeing
And We gave Musa the Book and made it a guidance to the children of Israel saying Do not take a protector besides Me
The offspring of those whom We bore with Nuh surely he was a grateful servant
And We had made known to the children of Israel in the Book Most certainly you will make mischief in the land twice and most certainly you will behave insolently with great insolence
So when the promise for the first of the two came We sent over you Our servants of mighty prowess so they went to and fro among the houses and it was a promise to be accomplished
Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them and aided you with wealth and children and made you a numerous band
If you do good you will do good for your own souls and if you do evil it shall be for them
So when the second promise came We raised another people that they may bring you to grief and that they may enter the mosque as they entered it the first time and that they might destroy whatever they gained ascendancy over with utter destruction
It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you and if you again return to disobedience We too will return to punishment and We have made hell a prison for the unbelievers
Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright and gives good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a great reward
And that as for those who do not believe in the hereafter We have prepared for them a painful chastisement
And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good and man is ever hasty
And We have made the night and the day two signs then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and We have made the sign of the day manifest so that you may seek grace from your Lord and that you might know the numbering of years and the reckoning and We have explained everything with distinctness
And We have made every man s actions to cling to his neck and We will bring forth to him on the resurrection day a book which he will find wide open
Read your book your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you this day
Whoever goes aright for his own soul does he go aright and whoever goes astray to its detriment only does he go astray nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another nor do We chastise until We raise an apostle
And when We wish to destroy a town We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives but they transgress therein thus the word proves true against it so We destroy it with utter destruction
And how many of the generations did We destroy after Nuh and your Lord is sufficient as Knowing and Seeing with regard to His servants faults
Whoever desires this present life We hasten to him therein what We please for whomsoever We desire then We assign to him the hell he shall enter it despised driven away
And whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it as he ought to strive and he is a believer as for these their striving shall surely be accepted
All do We aid these as well as those out of the bounty of your Lord and the bounty of your Lord is not confined
See how We have made some of them to excel others and certainly the hereafter is much superior in respect of excellence
Do not associate with Allah any other god lest you sit down despised neglected
And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve any but Him and goodness to your parents
If either or both of them reach old age with you say not to them so much as Ugh nor chide them and speak to them a generous word
And make yourself submissively gentle to them with compassion and say O my Lord have compassion on them as they brought me up when I was little
Your Lord knows best what is in your minds if you are good then He is surely Forgiving to those who turn to Him frequently
And give to the near of kin his due and to the needy and the wayfarer and do not squander wastefully
Surely the squanderers are the fellows of the Shaitans and the Shaitan is ever ungrateful to his Lord
And if you turn away from them to seek mercy from your Lord which you hope for speak to them a gentle word
And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck nor stretch it forth to the utmost limit of its stretching forth lest you should afterwards sit down blamed stripped off
Surely your Lord makes plentiful the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and He straitens them surely He is ever Aware of Seeing His servants
And do not kill your children for fear of poverty We give them sustenance and yourselves too surely to kill them is a great wrong
And go not nigh to fornication surely it is an indecency and an evil way
And do not kill any one whom Allah has forbidden except for a just cause and whoever is slain unjustly We have indeed given to his heir authority so let him not exceed the just limits in slaying surely he is aided
And draw not near to the property of the orphan except in a goodly way till he attains his maturity and fulfill the promise surely every promise shall be questioned about
And give full measure when you measure out and weigh with a true balance this is fair and better in the end
And follow not that of which you have not the knowledge surely the hearing and the sight and the heart all of these shall be questioned about that
And do not go about in the land exultingly for you cannot cut through the earth nor reach the mountains in height
All this the evil of it is hateful in the sight of your Lord
This is of what your Lord has revealed to you of wisdom and do not associate any other god with Allah lest you should be thrown into hell blamed cast away
What has then your Lord preferred to give you sons and for Himself taken daughters from among the angels
Most surely you utter a grievous saying
And certainly We have repeated warnings in this Quran that they may be mindful but it does not add save to their aversion
Say If there were with Him gods as they say then certainly they would have been able to seek a way to the Lord of power
Glory be to Him and exalted be He in high exaltation above what they say
The seven heavens declare His glory and the earth too and those who are in them and there is not a single thing but glorifies Him with His praise but you do not understand their glorification surely He is Forbearing Forgiving
And when you recite the Quran We place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier
And We have placed coverings on their hearts and a heaviness in their ears lest they understand it and when you mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion
We know best what they listen to when they listen to you and when they take counsel secretly when the unjust say You follow only a man deprived of reason
See what they liken you to
So they have gone astray and cannot find the way
And they say What when we shall have become bones and decayed particles shall we then certainly be raised up being a new creation
Say Become stones or iron
Or some other creature of those which are too hard to receive life in your minds
But they will say Who will return us
Say Who created you at first
Still they will shake their heads at you and say When will it be
Say Maybe it has drawn nigh
On the day when He will call you forth then shall you obey Him giving Him praise and you will think that you tarried but a little while
And say to My servants that they speak that which is best surely the Shaitan sows dissensions among them surely the Shaitan is an open enemy to man
Your Lord knows you best He will have mercy on you if He pleases or He will chastise you if He pleases and We have not sent you as being in charge of them
And your Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth and certainly We have made some of the prophets to excel others and to Dawood We gave a scripture
Say Call on those whom you assert besides Him so they shall not control the removal of distress from you nor its transference
Those whom they call upon themselves seek the means of access to their Lord whoever of them is nearest and they hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement surely the chastisement of your Lord is a thing to be cautious of
And there is not a town but We will destroy it before the day of resurrection or chastise it with a severe chastisement this is written in the Divine ordinance
And nothing could have hindered Us that We should send signs except that the ancients rejected them and We gave to Samood the shecamel a manifest sign but on her account they did injustice and We do not send signs but to make men fear
And when We said to you Surely your Lord encompasses men and We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for men and the cursed tree in the Quran as well and We cause them to fear but it only adds to their great inordinacy
And when We said to the angels Make obeisance to Adam they made obeisance but Iblis did it not
He said Shall I make obeisance to him whom Thou hast created of dust
He said Tell me is this he whom Thou hast honored above me
If Thou shouldst respite me to the day of resurrection I will most certainly cause his progeny to perish except a few
He said Be gone for whoever of them will follow you then surely hell is your recompense a full recompense
And beguile whomsoever of them you can with your voice and collect against them your forces riding and on foot and share with them in wealth and children and hold out promises to them and the Shaitan makes not promises to them but to deceive
Surely as for My servants you have no authority over them and your Lord is sufficient as a Protector
Your Lord is He Who speeds the ships for you in the sea that you may seek of His grace surely He is ever Merciful to you
And when distress afflicts you in the sea away go those whom you call on except He but when He brings you safe to the land you turn aside and man is ever ungrateful
What Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a tract of land to engulf you or send on you a tornado
Then you shall not find a protector for yourselves
Or do you feel secure that He will not take you back into it another time then send on you a fierce gale and thus drown you on account of your ungratefulness Then you shall not find any aider against Us in the matter
And surely We have honored the children of Adam and We carry them in the land and the sea and We have given them of the good things and We have made them to excel by an appropriate excellence over most of those whom We have created
Remember the day when We will call every people with their Imam then whoever is given his book in his right hand these shall read their book and they shall not be dealt with a whit unjustly
And whoever is blind in this he shall also be blind in the hereafter and more erring from the way
And surely they had purposed to turn you away from that which We have revealed to you that you should forge against Us other than that and then they would certainly have taken you for a friend
And had it not been that We had already established you you would certainly have been near to incline to them a little
In that case We would certainly have made you to taste a double punishment in this life and a double punishment after death then you would not have found any helper against Us
And surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they might expel you from it and in that case they will not tarry behind you but a little
This is Our course with regard to those of Our apostles whom We sent before you and you shall not find a change in Our course
Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night and the morning recitation surely the morning recitation is witnessed
And during a part of the night pray Tahajjud beyond what is incumbent on you maybe your Lord will raise you to a position of great glory
And say My Lord make me to enter a goodly entering and cause me to go forth a goodly going forth and grant me from near Thee power to assist me
And say The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished surely falsehood is a vanishing thing
And We reveal of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers and it adds only to the perdition of the unjust
And when We bestow favor on man he turns aside and behaves proudly and when evil afflicts him he is despairing
Say Every one acts according to his manner but your Lord best knows who is best guided in the path
And they ask you about the soul Say The soul is one of the commands of my Lord and you are not given aught of knowledge but a little
And if We please We should certainly take away that which We have revealed to you then you would not find for it any protector against Us
But on account of mercy from your Lord surely His grace to you is abundant
Say If men and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this Quran they could not bring the like of it though some of them were aiders of others
And certainly We have explained for men in this Quran every kind of similitude but most men do not consent to aught but denying
And they say We will by no means believe in you until you cause a fountain to gush forth from the earth for us
Or you should have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of which you should cause rivers to flow forth gushing out
Or you should cause the heaven to come down upon us in pieces as you think or bring Allah and the angels face to face with us
Or you should have a house of gold or you should ascend into heaven and we will not believe in your ascending until you bring down to us a book which we may read Say Glory be to my Lord am I aught but a mortal apostle
And nothing prevented people from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said What has Allah raised up a mortal to be an apostle
Say Had there been in the earth angels walking about as settlers We would certainly have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as an apostle
Say Allah suffices as a witness between me and you surely He is Aware of His servants Seeing
And whomsoever Allah guides he is the follower of the right way and whomsoever He causes to err you shall not find for him guardians besides Him and We will gather them together on the day of resurrection on their faces blind and dumb and deaf their abode is hell whenever it becomes allayed We will add to their burning
This is their retribution because they disbelieved in Our communications and said What when we shall have become bones and decayed particles shall we then indeed be raised up into a new creation
Do they not consider that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is able to create their like and He has appointed for them a doom about which there is no doubt
But the unjust do not consent to aught but denying
Say If you control the treasures of the mercy of my Lord then you would withhold them from fear of spending and man is niggardly
And certainly We gave Musa nine clear signs so ask the children of Israel
When he came to them Firon said to him Most surely I deem you O Musa to be a man deprived of reason
He said Truly you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proof and most surely I believe you O Firon to be given over to perdition
So he desired to destroy them out of the earth but We drowned him and those with him all together
And We said to the Israelites after him Dwell in the land and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass we will bring you both together in judgment
And with truth have We revealed it and with truth did it come and We have not sent you but as the giver of good news and as a warner
And it is a Quran which We have revealed in portions so that you may read it to the people by slow degrees and We have revealed it revealing in portions
Say Believe in it or believe not surely those who are given the knowledge before it fall down on their faces making obeisance when it is recited to them
And they say Glory be to our Lord most surely the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled
And they fall down on their faces weeping and it adds to their humility
Say Call upon Allah or call upon the Beneficent Allah whichever you call upon He has the best names and do not utter your prayer with a very raised voice nor be silent with regard to it and seek a way between these
And say All praise is due to Allah Who has not taken a son and Who has not a partner in the kingdom and Who has not a helper to save Him from disgrace and proclaim His greatness magnifying Him
All praise is due to Allah Who revealed the Book to His servant and did not make in it any crookedness
Rightly directing that he might give warning of severe punishment from Him and give good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a goodly reward
Staying in it for ever
And warn those who say Allah has taken a son
They have no knowledge of it nor had their fathers a grievous word it is that comes out of their mouths they speak nothing but a lie
Then maybe you will kill yourself with grief sorrowing after them if they do not believe in this announcement
Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellishment for it so that We may try them as to which of them is best in works
And most surely We will make what is on it bare ground without herbage
Or do you think that the Fellows of the Cave and the Inscription were of Our wonderful signs
When the youths sought refuge in the cave they said Our Lord grant us mercy from Thee and provide for us a right course in our affair
So We prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years
Then We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties was best able to compute the time for which they remained
We relate to you their story with the truth surely they were youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance
And We strengthened their hearts with patience when they stood up and said Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth we will by no means call upon any god besides Him for then indeed we should have said an extravagant thing
These our people have taken gods besides Him why do they not produce any clear authority in their support
Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah
And when you forsake them and what they worship save Allah betake yourselves for refuge to the cave your Lord will extend to you largely of His mercy and provide for you a profitable course in your affair
And you might see the sun when it rose decline from their cave towards the right hand and when it set leave them behind on the left while they were in a wide space thereof This is of the signs of Allah whomsoever Allah guides he is the rightly guided one and whomsoever He causes to err you shall not find for him any friend to lead him aright
And you might think them awake while they were asleep and We turned them about to the right and to the left while their dog lay outstretching its paws at the entrance if you looked at them you would certainly turn back from them in flight and you would certainly be filled with awe because of them
And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other
A speaker among them said How long have you tarried
They said We have tarried for a day or a part of a day
Others said Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried
Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city then let him see which of them has purest food so let him bring you provision from it and let him behave with gentleness and by no means make your case known to any one
For surely if they prevail against you they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion and then you will never succeed
And thus did We make men to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah s promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it
When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said Erect an edifice over them their Lord best knows them
Those who prevailed in their affair said We will certainly raise a masjid over them
Some say They are three the fourth of them being their dog and others say Five the sixth of them being their dog making conjectures at what is unknown and others yet say Seven and the eighth of them is their dog Say My Lord best knows their number none knows them but a few therefore contend not in the matter of them but with an outward contention and do not question concerning them any of them
And do not say of anything Surely I will do it tomorrow
Unless Allah pleases and remember your Lord when you forget and say Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the right than this
And they remained in their cave three hundred years and some add another nine
Say Allah knows best how long they remained to Him are known the unseen things of the heavens and the earth how clear His sight and how clear His hearing There is none to be a guardian for them besides Him and He does not make any one His associate in His Judgment
And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord there is none who can alter His words and you shall not find any refuge besides Him
And withhold yourself with those who call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill and let not your eyes pass from them desiring the beauties of this world s life and do not follow him whose heart We have made unmindful to Our remembrance and he follows his low desires and his case is one in which due bounds are exceeded
And say The truth is from your Lord so let him who please believe and let him who please disbelieve surely We have prepared for the iniquitous a fire the curtains of which shall encompass them about and if they cry for water they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces evil the drink and ill the restingplace
Surely as for those who believe and do good We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work
These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow ornaments shall be given to them therein of bracelets of gold and they shall wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold reclining therein on raised couches excellent the recompense and goodly the resting place
And set forth to them a parable of two men for one of them We made two gardens of grape vines and We surrounded them both with palms and in the midst of them We made cornfields
Both these gardens yielded their fruits and failed not aught thereof and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst
And he possessed much wealth so he said to his companion while he disputed with him I have greater wealth than you and am mightier in followers
And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself He said I do not think that this will ever perish
And I do not think the hour will come and even if I am returned to my Lord I will most certainly find a returning place better than this
His companion said to him while disputing with him Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust then from a small seed then He made you a perfect man
But as for me He Allah is my Lord and I do not associate anyone with my Lord
And wherefore did you not say when you entered your garden It is as Allah has pleased there is no power save in Allah
If you consider me to be inferior to you in wealth and children
Then maybe my Lord will give me what is better than your garden and send on it a thunderbolt from heaven so that it shall become even ground without plant
Or its waters should sink down into the ground so that you are unable to find it
And his wealth was destroyed so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it while it lay having fallen down upon its roofs and he said Ah me would that I had not associated anyone with my Lord
And he had no host to help him besides Allah nor could he defend himself
Here is protection only Allah s the True One He is best in the giving of reward and best in requiting
And set forth to them parable of the life of this world like water which We send down from the cloud so the herbage of the earth becomes tangled on account of it then it becomes dry broken into pieces which the winds scatter and Allah is the holder of power over all things
Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world and the everabiding the good works are better with your Lord in reward and better in expectation
And the day on which We will cause the mountains to pass away and you will see the earth a levelled plain and We will gather them and leave not any one of them behind
And they shall be brought before your Lord standing in ranks Now certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first
Nay you thought that We had not appointed to you a time of the fulfillment of the promise
And the Book shall be placed then you will see the guilty fearing from what is in it and they will say Ah woe to us what a book is this it does not omit a small one nor a great one but numbers them all and what they had done they shall find present there and your Lord does not deal unjustly with anyone
And when We said to the angels Make obeisance to Adam they made obeisance but Iblis did it not
He was of the jinn so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord
What would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me and they are your enemies
Evil is this change for the unjust
I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth nor of the creation of their own souls nor could I take those who lead others astray for aiders
And on the day when He shall say Call on those whom you considered to be My associates
So they shall call on them but they shall not answer them and We will cause a separation between them
And the guilty shall see the fire then they shall know that they are going to fall into it and they shall not find a place to which to turn away from it
And certainly We have explained in this Quran every kind of example and man is most of all given to contention
And nothing prevents men from believing when the guidance comes to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that what happened to the ancients should overtake them or that the chastisement should come face to face with them
And We do not send apostles but as givers of good news and warning and those who disbelieve make a false contention that they may render null thereby the truth and they take My communications and that with which they are warned for a mockery
And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord then he turns away from them and forgets what his two hands have sent before
Surely We have placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand it and a heaviness in their ears and if you call them to the guidance they will not ever follow the right course in that case
And your Lord is Forgiving the Lord of Mercy were He to punish them for what they earn He would certainly have hastened the chastisement for them but for them there is an appointed time from which they shall not find a refuge
And as for these towns We destroyed them when they acted unjustly and We have appointed a time for their destruction
And when Musa said to his servant I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two rivers or I will go on for years
So when they had reached the junction of the two rivers they forgot their fish and it took its way into the sea going away
But when they had gone farther he said to his servant Bring to us our morning meal certainly we have met with fatigue from this our journey
He said Did you see when we took refuge on the rock then I forgot the fish and nothing made me forget to speak of it but the Shaitan and it took its way into the river what a wonder
He said This is what we sought for so they returned retracing their footsteps
Then they found one from among Our servants whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourselves
Musa said to him Shall I follow you on condition that you should teach me right knowledge of what you have been taught
He said Surely you cannot have patience with me
And how can you have patience in that of which you have not got a comprehensive knowledge
He said If Allah pleases you will find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter
He said If you would follow me then do not question me about any thing until I myself speak to you about it
So they went their way until when they embarked in the boat he made a hole in it
Musa said Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates
Certainly you have done a grievous thing
He said Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me
He said Blame me not for what I forgot and do not constrain me to a difficult thing in my affair
So they went on until when they met a boy he slew him
Musa said Have you slain an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter
Certainly you have done an evil thing
He said Did I not say to you that you will not be able to have patience with me
He said If I ask you about anything after this keep me not in your company indeed you shall have then found an excuse in my case
So they went on until when they came to the people of a town they asked them for food but they refused to entertain them as guests
Then they found in it a wall which was on the point of falling so he put it into a right state
Musa said If you had pleased you might certainly have taken a recompense for it
He said This shall be separation between me and you now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience
As for the boat it belonged to some poor men who worked on the river and I wished that I should damage it and there was behind them a king who seized every boat by force
And as for the boy his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them
So we desired that their Lord might give them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer to having compassion
And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them and their father was a righteous man so your Lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure a mercy from your Lord and I did not do it of my own accord This is the significance of that with which you could not have patience
And they ask you about Zulqarnain
Say I will recite to you an account of him
Surely We established him in the land and granted him means of access to every thing
So he followed a course
Until when he reached the place where the sun set he found it going down into a black sea and found by it a people
We said O Zulqarnain either give them a chastisement or do them a benefit
He said As to him who is unjust we will chastise him then shall he be returned to his Lord and He will chastise him with an exemplary chastisement
And as for him who believes and does good he shall have goodly reward and We will speak to him an easy word of Our command
Then he followed another course
Until when he reached the land of the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people to whom We had given no shelter from It
Even so and We had a full knowledge of what he had
Then he followed another course
Until when he reached a place between the two mountains he found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a word
They said O Zulqarnain surely Gog and Magog make mischief in the land
Shall we then pay you a tribute on condition that you should raise a barrier between us and them
He said That in which my Lord has established me is better therefore you only help me with workers I will make a fortified barrier between you and them
Bring me blocks of iron until when he had filled up the space between the two mountain sides he said Blow until when he had made it as fire he said Bring me molten brass which I may pour over it
So they were not able to scale it nor could they make a hole in it
He said This is a mercy from my Lord but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass He will make it level with the ground and the promise of my Lord is ever true
And on that day We will leave a part of them in conflict with another part and the trumpet will be blown so We will gather them all together
And We will bring forth hell exposed to view on that day before the unbelievers
They whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they could not even hear
What do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants to be guardians besides Me
Surely We have prepared hell for the entertainment of the unbelievers
Say Shall We inform you of the greatest losers in their deeds
These are they whose labor is lost in this world s life and they think that they are well versed in skill of the work of hands
These are they who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord and His meeting so their deeds become null and therefore We will not set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection
Thus it is that their recompense is hell because they disbelieved and held My communications and My apostles in mockery
Surely as for those who believe and do good deeds their place of entertainment shall be the gardens of paradise
Abiding therein they shall not desire removal from them
Say If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord the sea would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are exhausted though We were to bring the like of that sea to add
Say I am only a mortal like you it is revealed to me that your god is one Allah therefore whoever hopes to meet his Lord he should do good deeds and not join any one in the service of his Lord
Kaf Ha Ya Ain Suad
A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya
When he called upon his Lord in a low voice
He said My Lord surely my bones are weakened and my head flares with hoariness and my Lord I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to Thee
And surely I fear my cousins after me and my wife is barren therefore grant me from Thyself an heir
Who should inherit me and inherit from the children of Yaqoub and make him my Lord one in whom Thou art well pleased
O Zakariya surely We give you good news of a boy whose name shall be Yahya We have not made before anyone his equal
He said O my Lord when shall I have a son and my wife is barren and I myself have reached indeed the extreme degree of old age
He said So shall it be your Lord says It is easy to Me and indeed I created you before when you were nothing
He said My Lord give me a sign
He said Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in sound health
So he went forth to his people from his place of worship then he made known to them that they should glorify Allah morning and evening
O Yahya take hold of the Book with strength and We granted him wisdom while yet a child
And tenderness from Us and purity and he was one who guarded against evil
And dutiful to his parents and he was not insolent disobedient
And peace on him on the day he was born and on the day he dies and on the day he is raised to life
And mention Marium in the Book when she drew aside from her family to an eastern place
So she took a veil to screen herself from them then We sent to her Our spirit and there appeared to her a wellmade man
She said Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent Allah if you are one guarding against evil
He said I am only a messenger of your Lord That I will give you a pure boy
She said When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet touched me nor have I been unchaste
He said Even so your Lord says It is easy to Me and that We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us and it is a matter which has been decreed
So she conceived him then withdrew herself with him to a remote place
And the throes of childbirth compelled her to betake herself to the trunk of a palm tree She said Oh would that I had died before this and had been a thing quite forgotten
Then the child called out to her from beneath her Grieve not surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you
And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree it will drop on you fresh ripe dates
So eat and drink and refresh the eye
Then if you see any mortal say Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent Allah so I shall not speak to any man today
And she came to her people with him carrying him with her
They said O Marium surely you have done a strange thing
O sister of Haroun your father was not a bad man nor was your mother an unchaste woman
But she pointed to him
They said How should we speak to one who was a child in the cradle
He said Surely I am a servant of Allah He has given me the Book and made me a prophet
And He has made me blessed wherever I may be and He has enjoined on me prayer and poorrate so long as I live
And dutiful to my mother and He has not made me insolent unblessed
And peace on me on the day I was born and on the day I die and on the day I am raised to life
Such is Isa son of Marium this is the saying of truth about which they dispute
It beseems not Allah that He should take to Himself a son glory to be Him when He has decreed a matter He only says to it Be and it is
And surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord therefore serve Him this is the right path
But parties from among them disagreed with each other so woe to those who disbelieve because of presence on a great day
How clearly shall they hear and how clearly shall they see on the day when they come to Us but the unjust this day are in manifest error
And warn them of the day of intense regret when the matter shall have been decided and they are now in negligence and they do not believe
Surely We inherit the earth and all those who are on it and to Us they shall be returned
And mention Ibrahim in the Book surely he was a truthful man a prophet
When he said to his father O my father why do you worship what neither hears nor sees nor does it avail you in the least
O my father truly the knowledge has come to me which has not come to you therefore follow me I will guide you on a right path
O my father serve not the Shaitan surely the Shaitan is disobedient to the Beneficent Allah
O my father surely I fear that a punishment from the Beneficent Allah should afflict you so that you should be a friend of the Shaitan
He said Do you dislike my gods O Ibrahim
If you do not desist I will certainly revile you and leave me for a time
He said Peace be on you I will pray to my Lord to forgive you surely He is ever Affectionate to me
And I will withdraw from you and what you call on besides Allah and I will call upon my Lord may be I shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord
So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides Allah We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub and each one of them We made a prophet
And We granted to them of Our mercy and We left behind them a truthful mention of eminence for them
And mention Musa in the Book surely he was one purified and he was an apostle a prophet
And We called to him from the blessed side of the mountain and We made him draw nigh holding communion with Us
And We gave to him out of Our mercy his brother Haroun a prophet
And mention Ismail in the Book surely he was truthful in his promise and he was an apostle a prophet
And he enjoined on his family prayer and almsgiving and was one in whom his Lord was well pleased
And mention Idris in the Book surely he was a truthful man a prophet
And We raised him high in Heaven
These are they on whom Allah bestowed favors from among the prophets of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried with Nuh and of the seed of Ibrahim and Israel and of those whom We guided and chose when the communications of the Beneficent Allah were recited to them they fell down making obeisance and weeping
But there came after them an evil generation who neglected prayers and followed and sensual desires so they win meet perdition
Except such as repent and believe and do good these shall enter the garden and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in any way
The gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent Allah has promised to His servants while unseen surely His promise shall come to pass
They shall not hear therein any vain discourse but only Peace and they shall have their sustenance therein morning and evening
This is the garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who guard against evil
And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between these and your Lord is not forgetful
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them so serve Him and be patient in His service
Do you know any one equal to Him
And says man What when I am dead shall I truly be brought forth alive
Does not man remember that We created him before when he was nothing
So by your Lord
We will most certainly gather them together and the Shaitans then shall We certainly cause them to be present round hell on their knees
Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the Beneficent Allah
Again We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned therein
And there is not one of you but shall come to it this is an unavoidable decree of your Lord
And We will deliver those who guarded against evil and We will leave the unjust therein on their knees
And when Our clear communications are recited to them those who disbelieve say to those who believe Which of the two parties is best in abiding and best in assembly
And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them who were better in respect of goods and outward appearance
Say As for him who remains in error the Beneficent Allah will surely prolong his length of days until they see what they were threatened with either the punishment or the hour then they shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in forces
And Allah increases in guidance those who go aright and everabiding good works are with your Lord best in recompense and best in yielding fruit
Have you then seen him who disbelieves in Our communications and says I shall certainly be given wealth and children
Has he gained knowledge of the unseen or made a covenant with the Beneficent Allah
By no means We write down what he says and We will lengthen to him the length of the chastisement
And We will inherit of him what he says and he shall come to Us alone
And they have taken gods besides Allah that they should be to them a source of strength
By no means They shall soon deny their worshipping them and they shall be adversaries to them
Do you not see that We have sent the Shaitans against the unbelievers inciting them by incitement
Therefore be not in haste against them We only number out to them a number of days
The day on which We will gather those who guard against evil to the Beneficent Allah to receive honors
And We will drive the guilty to hell thirsty
They shall not control intercession save he who has made a covenant with the Beneficent Allah
And they say The Beneficent Allah has taken to Himself a son
Certainly you have made an abominable assertion
The heavens may almost be rent thereat and the earth cleave asunder and the mountains fall down in pieces
That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent Allah
And it is not worthy of the Beneficent Allah that He should take to Himself a son
There is no one in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Beneficent Allah as a servant
Certainly He has a comprehensive knowledge of them and He has numbered them a comprehensive numbering
And every one of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection alone
Surely as for those who believe and do good deeds for them will Allah bring about love
So We have only made it easy in your tongue that you may give good news thereby to those who guard against evil and warn thereby a vehemently contentious people
And how many a generation have We destroyed before them
Do you see any one of them or hear a sound of them
Ta Ha
We have not revealed the Quran to you that you may be unsuccessful
Nay it is a reminder to him who fears
A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens
The Beneficent Allah is firm in power
His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what is between them two and what is beneath the ground
And if you utter the saying aloud then surely He knows the secret and what is yet more hidden
Allah there is no god but He His are the very best names
And has the story of Musa come to you
When he saw fire he said to his family Stop for surely I see a fire haply I may bring to you therefrom a live coal or find a guidance at the fire
So when he came to it a voice was uttered O Musa
Surely I am your Lord therefore put off your shoes surely you are in the sacred valley Tuwa
And I have chosen you so listen to what is revealed
Surely I am Allah there is no god but I therefore serve Me and keep up prayer for My remembrance
Surely the hour is coming I am about to make it manifest so that every soul may be rewarded as it strives
Therefore let not him who believes not in it and follows his low desires turn you away from it so that you should perish
And what is this in your right hand O Musa
He said This is my staff I recline on it and I beat the leaves with it to make them fall upon my sheep and I have other uses for it
He said Cast it down O Musa
So he cast it down and lo it was a serpent running
He said Take hold of it and fear not We will restore it to its former state
And press your hand to your side it shall come out white without evil another sign
That We may show you of Our greater signs
Go to Firon surely he has exceeded all limits
He said O my Lord
Expand my breast for me
And make my affair easy to me
And loose the knot from my tongue
That they may understand my word
And give to me an aider from my family
Haroun my brother
Strengthen my back by him
And associate him with me in my affair
So that we should glorify Thee much
And remember Thee oft
Surely Thou art seeing us
He said You are indeed granted your petition O Musa
And certainly We bestowed on you a favor at another time
When We revealed to your mother what was revealed
Saying Put him into a chest then cast it down into the river then the river shall throw him on the shore there shall take him up one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him and I cast down upon you love from Me and that you might be brought up before My eyes
When your sister went and said Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him So We brought you back to your mother that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve and you killed a man then We delivered you from the grief and We tried you with a severe trying Then you stayed for years among the people of Madyan then you came hither as ordained O Musa
And I have chosen you for Myself
Go you and your brother with My communications and be not remiss in remembering Me
Go both to Firon surely he has become inordinate
Then speak to him a gentle word haply he may mind or fear
Both said O our Lord
Surely we fear that he may hasten to do evil to us or that he may become inordinate
He said Fear not surely I am with you both I do hear and see
So go you both to him and say Surely we are two apostles of your Lord therefore send the children of Israel with us and do not torment them
Indeed we have brought to you a communication from your Lord and peace is on him who follows the guidance
Surely it has been revealed to us that the chastisement will surely come upon him who rejects and turns back
Firon said And who is your Lord O Musa
He said Our Lord is He Who gave to everything its creation then guided it to its goal
He said Then what is the state of the former generations
He said The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a book my Lord errs not nor does He forget
Who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you therein paths and sent down water from the cloud then thereby We have brought forth many species of various herbs
Eat and pasture your cattle most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding
From it We created you and into it We shall send you back and from it will We raise you a second time
And truly We showed him Our signs all of them but he rejected and refused
Said he Have you come to us that you should turn us out of our land by your magic O Musa
So we too will produce before you magic like it therefore make between us and you an appointment which we should not break neither we nor you in a central place
Musa said Your appointment is the day of the Festival and let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon
So Firon turned his back and settled his plan then came
Musa said to them Woe to you do not forge a lie against Allah lest He destroy you by a punishment and he who forges a lie indeed fails to attain his desire
So they disputed with one another about their affair and kept the discourse secret
They said These are most surely two magicians who wish to turn you out from your land by their magic and to take away your best traditions
Therefore settle your plan then come standing in ranks and he will prosper indeed this day who overcomes
They said O Musa will you cast or shall we be the first who cast down
He said Nay cast down then lo their cords and their rods it was imaged to him on account of their magic as if they were running
So Musa conceived in his mind a fear
We said Fear not surely you shall be the uppermost
And cast down what is in your right hand it shall devour what they have wrought they have wrought only the plan of a magician and the magician shall not be successful wheresoever he may come from
And the magicians were cast down making obeisance they said We believe in the Lord of Haroun and Musa
Firon said You believe in him before I give you leave most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment therefore I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I will certainly crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees and certainly you will come to know which of us is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising
They said We do not prefer you to what has come to us of clear arguments and to He Who made us therefore decide what you are going to decide you can only decide about this world s life
Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us and Allah is better and more abiding
Whoever comes to his Lord being guilty for him is surely hell he shall not die therein nor shall he live
And whoever comes to Him a believer and he has done good deeds indeed these it is who shall have the high ranks
The gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow to abide therein and this is the reward of him who has purified himself
And certainly We revealed to Musa saying Travel by night with My servants then make for them a dry path in the sea not fearing to be overtaken nor being afraid
And Firon followed them with his armies so there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them
And Firon led astray his people and he did not guide them aright
O children of Israel indeed We delivered you from your enemy and We made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the mountain and We sent to you the manna and the quails
Eat of the good things We have given you for sustenance and be not inordinate with respect to them lest My wrath should be due to you and to whomsoever My wrath is due be shall perish indeed
And most surely I am most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good then continues to follow the right direction
And what caused you to hasten from your people O Musa
He said They are here on my track and I hastened on to Thee my Lord that Thou mightest be pleased
He said So surely We have tried your people after you and the Samiri has led them astray
So Musa returned to his people wrathful sorrowing Said he O my people did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise did then the time seem long to you or did you wish that displeasure from your Lord should be due to you so that you broke your promise to me
They said We did not break our promise to you of our own accord but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of the people then we made a casting of them and thus did the Samiri suggest
So he brought forth for them a calf a mere body which had a mooing sound so they said This is your god and the god of Musa but he forgot
What could they not see that it did not return to them a reply and that it did not control any harm or benefit for them
And certainly Haroun had said to them before O my people you are only tried by it and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah therefore follow me and obey my order
They said We will by no means cease to keep to its worship until Musa returns to us
Musa said O Haroun what prevented you when you saw them going astray
So that you did not follow me
Did you then disobey my order
He said O son of my mother seize me not by my beard nor by my head surely I was afraid lest you should say You have caused a division among the children of Israel and not waited for my word
He said What was then your object O Samiri
He said I saw Jibreel what they did not see so I took a handful of the dust from the footsteps of the messenger then I threw it in the casting thus did my soul commend to me
He said Begone then surely for you it will be in this life to say Touch me not and surely there is a threat for you which shall not be made to fail to you and look at your god to whose worship you kept so long we will certainly burn it then we will certainly scatter it a wide scattering in the sea
Your Allah is only Allah there is no god but He He comprehends all things in His knowledge
Thus do We relate to you some of the news of what has gone before and indeed We have given to you a Reminder from Ourselves
Whoever turns aside from it he shall surely bear a burden on the day of resurrection
Abiding in this state and evil will it be for them to bear on the day of resurrection
On the day when the trumpet shall be blown and We will gather the guilty blueeyed on that day
They shall consult together secretly You did tarry but ten centuries
We know best what they say when the fairest of them in course would say You tarried but a day
And they ask you about the mountains
Say My Lord will carry them away from the roots
Then leave it a plain smooth level
You shall not see therein any crookedness or unevenness
On that day they shall follow the inviter there is no crookedness in him and the voices shall be low before the Beneficent Allah so that you shall not hear aught but a soft sound
On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom the Beneficent Allah allows and whose word He is pleased with
He knows what is before them and what is behind them while they do not comprehend it in knowledge
And the faces shall be humbled before the Living the Selfsubsistent Allah and he who bears iniquity is indeed a failure
And whoever does good works and he is a believer he shall have no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of his due
And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Quran and have distinctly set forth therein of threats that they may guard against evil or that it may produce a reminder for them
Supremely exalted is therefore Allah the King the Truth and do not make haste with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you and say O my Lord increase me in knowledge
And certainly We gave a commandment to Adam before but he forgot and We did not find in him any determination
And when We said to the angels Make obeisance to Adam they made obeisance but Iblis did it not he refused
So We said O Adam
This is an enemy to you and to your wife therefore let him not drive you both forth from the garden so that you should be unhappy
Surely it is ordained for you that you shall not be hungry therein nor bare of clothing
And that you shall not be thirsty therein nor shall you feel the heat of the sun
But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him he said O Adam
Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which decays not
Then they both ate of it so their evil inclinations became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with leaves of the garden and Adam disobeyed his Lord so his life became evil to him
Then his Lord chose him so He turned to him and guided him
He said Get forth you two therefrom all of you one of you is enemy to another
So there will surely come to you guidance from Me then whoever follows My guidance he shall not go astray nor be unhappy
And whoever turns away from My reminder his shall be a straitened life and We will raise him on the day of resurrection blind
He shall say My Lord why hast Thou raised me blind and I was a seeing one indeed
He will say Even so Our communications came to you but you neglected them even thus shall you be forsaken this day
And thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and does not believe in the communications of his Lord and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more
Does it not then direct them aright how many of the generations In whose dwellingplaces they go about We destroyed before them
Most surely there are signs in this for those endowed with understanding
And had there not been a word that had already gone forth from your Lord and an appointed term it would surely have been made to cleave to them
Bear then patiently what they say and glorify your Lord by the praising of Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting and during hours of the night do also glorify Him and during parts of the day that you may be well pleased
And do not stretch your eyes after that with which We have provided different classes of them of the splendor of this world s life that We may thereby try them and the sustenance given by your Lord is better and more abiding
And enjoin prayer on your followers and steadily adhere to it We do not ask you for subsistence We do give you subsistence and the good end is for guarding against evil
And they say Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord
Has not there come to them a clear evidence of what is in the previous books
And had We destroyed them with chastisement before this they would certainly have said O our Lord why didst Thou not send to us an apostle for then we should have followed Thy communications before that we met disgrace and shame
Say Every one of us is awaiting therefore do await So you will come to know who is the follower of the even path and who goes aright
Their reckoning has drawn near to men and in heedlessness are they turning aside
There comes not to them a new reminder from their Lord but they hear it while they sport
Their hearts trifling and those who are unjust counsel together in secret He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves what will you then yield to enchantment while you see
He said My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and the earth and He is the Hearing the Knowing
Nay say they Medleys of dreams nay he has forged it nay he is a poet so let him bring to us a sign as the former prophets were sent with
There did not believe before them any town which We destroyed will they then believe
And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation so ask the followers of the reminder if you do not
And We did not make them bodies not eating the food and they were not to abide forever
Then We made Our promise good to them so We delivered them and those whom We pleased and We destroyed the extravagant
Certainly We have revealed to you a Book in which is your good remembrance what do you not then understand
And how many a town which was iniquitous did We demolish and We raised up after it another people
So when they felt Our punishment lo they began to fly
Do not fly now and come back to what you were made to lead easy lives in and to your dwellings haply you will be questioned
They said O woe to us surely we were unjust
And this ceased not to be their cry till We made them cut off extinct
And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport
Had We wished to make a diversion We would have made it from before Ourselves by no means would We do it
Nay
We cast the truth against the falsehood so that it breaks its head and lo it vanishes and woe to you for what you describe
And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His and those who are with Him are not proud to serve Him nor do they grow weary
They glorify Him by night and day they are never languid
Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise the dead
If there had been in them any gods except Allah they would both have certainly been in a state of disorder therefore glory be to Allah the Lord of the dominion above what they attribute to Him
He cannot be questioned concerning what He does and they shall be questioned
Or have they taken gods besides Him
Say Bring your proof this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me
Nay most of them do not know the truth so they turn aside
And We did not send before you any apostle but We revealed to him that there is no god but Me therefore serve Me
And they say The Beneficent Allah has taken to Himself a son
Glory be to Him
Nay they are honored servants
They do not precede Him in speech and only according to His commandment do they act
He knows what is before them and what is behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves and for fear of Him they tremble
And whoever of them should say Surely I am a god besides Him such a one do We recompense with hell thus do We recompense the unjust
Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up but We have opened them and We have made of water everything living will they not then believe
And We have made great mountains in the earth lest it might be convulsed with them and We have made in it wide ways that they may follow a right direction
And We have made the heaven a guarded canopy and yet they turn aside from its signs
And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon all orbs travel along swiftly in their celestial spheres
And We did not ordain abiding for any mortal before you What
Then if you die will they abide
Every soul must taste of death and We try you by evil and good by way of probation and to Us you shall be brought back
And when those who disbelieve see you they do not take you but for one to be scoffed at Is this he who speaks of your gods
And they are deniers at the mention of the Beneficent Allah
Man is created of haste now will I show to you My signs therefore do not ask Me to hasten them on
And they say When will this threat come to pass if you are truthful
Had those who disbelieve but known of the time when they shall not be able to ward off the fire from their faces nor from their backs nor shall they be helped
Nay it shall come on them all of a sudden and cause them to become confounded so they shall not have the power to avert it nor shall they be respited
And certainly apostles before you were scoffed at then there befell those of them who scoffed that at which they had scoffed
Say Who guards you by night and by day from the Beneficent Allah
Nay they turn aside at the mention of their Lord
Or have they gods who can defend them against Us
They shall not be able to assist themselves nor shall they be defended from Us
Nay We gave provision to these and their fathers until life was prolonged to them
Do they not then see that We are visiting the land curtailing it of its sides
Shall they then prevail
Say I warn you only by revelation and the deaf do not hear the call whenever they are warned
And if a blast of the chastisement of your Lord were to touch them they will certainly say O woe to us surely we were unjust
And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least and though there be the weight of a grain of mustard seed yet will We bring it and sufficient are We to take account
And certainly We gave to Musa and Haroun the Furqan and a light and a reminder for those who would guard against evil
For those who fear their Lord in secret and they are fearful of the hour
And this is a blessed Reminder which We have revealed will you then deny it
And certainly We gave to Ibrahim his rectitude before and We knew him fully well
When he said to his father and his people What are these images to whose worship you cleave
They said We found our fathers worshipping them
He said Certainly you have been both you and your fathers in manifest error
They said Have you brought to us the truth or are you one of the triflers
He said Nay your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth Who brought them into existence and I am of those who bear witness to this
And by Allah I will certainly do something against your idols after you go away turning back
So he broke them into pieces except the chief of them that haply they may return to it
They said Who has done this to our gods Most surely he is one of the unjust
They said We heard a youth called Ibrahim speak of them
Said they Then bring him before the eyes of the people perhaps they may bear witness
They said Have you done this to our gods O Ibrahim
He said Surely some doer has done it the chief of them is this therefore ask them if they can speak
Then they turned to themselves and said Surely you yourselves are the unjust
Then they were made to hang down their heads Certainly you know that they do not speak
He said What do you then serve besides Allah what brings you not any benefit at all nor does it harm you
Fie on you and on what you serve besides Allah what do you not then understand
They said Burn him and help your gods if you are going to do anything
We said O fire be a comfort and peace to Ibrahim
And they desired a war on him but We made them the greatest losers
And We delivered him as well as Lut removing them to the land which We had blessed for all people
And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub a son s son and We made them all good
And We made them Imams who guided people by Our command and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms and Us alone did they serve
And as for Lut We gave him wisdom and knowledge and We delivered him from the town which wrought abominations surely they were an evil people transgressors
And We took him into Our mercy surely he was of the good
And Nuh when he cried aforetime so We answered him and delivered him and his followers from the great calamity
And We helped him against the people who rejected Our communications surely they were an evil people so We drowned them all
And Dawood and Sulaiman when they gave judgment concerning the field when the people s sheep pastured therein by night and We were bearers of witness to their judgment
So We made Sulaiman to understand it and to each one We gave wisdom and knowledge and We made the mountains and the birds to celebrate Our praise with Dawood and We were the doers
And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you that they might protect you in your wars will you then be grateful
And We made subservient to Sulaiman the wind blowing violent pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed and We are knower of all things
And of the rebellious people there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that and We kept guard over them
And Ayub when he cried to his Lord saying Harm has afflicted me and Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful
Therefore We responded to him and took off what harm he had and We gave him his family and the like of them with them a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers
And Ismail and Idris and Zulkifl all were of the patient ones
And We caused them to enter into Our mercy surely they were of the good ones
And Yunus when he went away in wrath so he thought that We would not straiten him so he called out among afflictions There is no god but Thou glory be to Thee surely I am of those who make themselves to suffer loss
So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief and thus do We deliver the believers
And Zakariya when he cried to his Lord O my Lord leave me not alone and Thou art the best of inheritors
So We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his wife fit for him surely they used to hasten one with another In deeds of goodness and to call upon Us hoping and fearing and they were humble before Us
And she who guarded her chastity so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and made her and her son a sign for the nations
Surely this Islam is your religion one religion only and I am your Lord therefore serve Me
And they broke their religion into sects between them to Us shall all come back
Therefore whoever shall do of good deeds and he is a believer there shall be no denying of his exertion and surely We will write It down for him
And it is binding on a town which We destroy that they shall not return
Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they shall break forth from every elevated place
And the true promise shall draw nigh then lo the eyes of those who disbelieved shall be fixedly open O woe to us surely we were in a state of heedlessness as to this nay we were unjust
Surely you and what you worship besides Allah are the firewood of hell to it you shall come
Had these been gods they would not have come to it and all shall abide therein
For them therein shall be groaning and therein they shall not hear
Surely as for those for whom the good has already gone forth from Us they shall be kept far off from it
They will not hear its faintest sound and they shall abide in that which their souls long for
The great fearful event shall not grieve them and the angels shall meet them This is your day which you were promised
On the day when We will roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll for writings as We originated the first creation so We shall reproduce it a promise binding on Us surely We will bring it about
And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder that as for the land My righteous servants shall inherit it
Most surely in this is a message to a people who serve
And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds
Say It is only revealed to me that your Allah is one Allah will you then submit
But if they turn back say I have given you warning in fairness and I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far
Surely He knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide
And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision till a time
He said O my Lord judge Thou with truth and our Lord is the Beneficent Allah Whose help is sought against what you ascribe to Him
O people guard against the punishment from your Lord surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing
On the day when you shall see it every woman giving suck shall quit in confusion what she suckled and every pregnant woman shall lay down her burden and you shall see men intoxicated and they shall not be intoxicated but the chastisement of Allah will be severe
And among men there is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious Shaitan
Against him it is written down that whoever takes him for a friend he shall lead him astray and conduct him to the chastisement of the burning fire
O people if you are in doubt about the raising then surely We created you from dust then from a small seed then from a clot then from a lump of flesh complete in make and incomplete that We may make clear to you and We cause what We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed time then We bring you forth as babies then that you may attain your maturity and of you is he who is caused to die and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of life so that after having knowledge he does not know anything and you see the earth sterile land but when We send down on it the water it stirs and swells and brings forth of every kind a beautiful herbage
This is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He has power over all things
And because the hour is coming there is no doubt about it and because Allah shall raise up those who are in the graves
And among men there is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without an illuminating book
Turning away haughtily that he may lead others astray from the way of Allah for him is disgrace in this world and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the punishment of burning
This is due to what your two hands have sent before and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants
And among men is he who serves Allah standing on the verge so that if good befalls him he is satisfied therewith but if a trial afflict him he turns back headlong he loses this world as well as the hereafter that is a manifest loss
He calls besides Allah upon that which does not harm him and that which does not profit him that is the great straying
He calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his profit evil certainly is the guardian and evil certainly is the associate
Surely Allah will cause those who believe and do good deeds to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow surely Allah does what He pleases
Whoever thinks that Allah will not assist him in this life and the hereafter let him stretch a rope to the ceiling then let him cut it off then let him see if his struggle will take away that at which he is enraged
And thus have We revealed it being clear arguments and because Allah guides whom He intends
Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associate others with Allah surely Allah will decide between them on the day of resurrection surely Allah is a witness over all things
Do you not see that Allah is He Whom obeys whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the animals and many of the people and many there are against whom chastisement has become necessary and whomsoever Allah abases there is none who can make him honorable surely Allah does what He pleases
These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord then as to those who disbelieve for them are cut out garments of fire boiling water shall be poured over their heads
With it shall be melted what is in their bellies and their skins as well
And for them are whips of iron
Whenever they will desire to go forth from it from grief they shall be turned back into it and taste the chastisement of burning
Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good deeds enter gardens beneath which rivers flow they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their garments therein shall be of silk
And they are guided to goodly words and they are guided into the path of the Praised One
Surely as for those who disbelieve and hinder men from Allah s way and from the Sacred Mosque which We have made equally for all men for the dweller therein and for the visitor and whoever shall incline therein to wrong unjustly We will make him taste of a painful chastisement
And when We assigned to Ibrahim the place of the House saying Do not associate with Me aught and purify My House for those who make the circuit and stand to pray and bow and prostrate themselves
And proclaim among men the Pilgrimage they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel coming from every remote path
That they may witness advantages for them and mention the name of Allah during stated days over what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds then eat of them and feed the distressed one the needy
Then let them accomplish their needful acts of shaving and cleansing and let them fulfil their vows and let them go round the Ancient House
That shall be so and whoever respects the sacred ordinances of Allah it is better for him with his Lord and the cattle are made lawful for you except that which is recited to you therefore avoid the uncleanness of the idols and avoid false words
Being upright for Allah not associating aught with Him and whoever associates others with Allah it is as though he had fallen from on high then the birds snatch him away or the wind carries him off to a fardistant place
That shall be so and whoever respects the signs of Allah this surely is the outcome of the piety of hearts
You have advantages in them till a fixed time then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House
And to every nation We appointed acts of devotion that they may mention the name of Allah on what He has given them of the cattle quadrupeds so your god is One God therefore to Him should you submit and give good news to the humble
To those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned and those who are patient under that which afflicts them and those who keep up prayer and spend benevolently out of what We have given them
And as for the camels We have made them of the signs of the religion of Allah for you for you therein is much good therefore mention the name of Allah on them as they stand in a row then when they fall down eat of them and feed the poor man who is contented and the beggar thus have We made them subservient to you that you may be grateful
There does not reach Allah their flesh nor their blood but to Him is acceptable the guarding against evil on your part thus has He made them subservient to you that you may magnify Allah because He has guided you aright and give good news to those who do good to others
Surely Allah will defend those who believe surely Allah does not love any one who is unfaithful ungrateful
Permission to fight is given to those upon whom war is made because they are oppressed and most surely Allah is well able to assist them
Those who have been expelled from their homes without a just cause except that they say Our Lord is Allah
And had there not been Allah s repelling some people by others certainly there would have been pulled down cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques in which Allah s name is much remembered and surely Allah will help him who helps His cause most surely Allah is Strong Mighty
Those who should We establish them in the land will keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and enjoin good and forbid evil and Allah s is the end of affairs
And if they reject you then already before you did the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood reject prophets
And the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut
As well as those of Madyan and Musa too was rejected but I gave respite to the unbelievers then did I overtake them so how severe was My disapproval
So how many a town did We destroy while it was unjust so it was fallen down upon its roofs and how many a deserted well and palace raised high
Have they not travelled in the land so that they should have hearts with which to understand or ears with which to hear
For surely it is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts which are in the breasts
And they ask you to hasten on the punishment and Allah will by no means fail in His promise and surely a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you number
And how many a town to which I gave respite while it was unjust then I overtook it and to Me is the return
Say O people
I am only a plain warner to you
Then as for those who believe and do good they shall have forgiveness and an honorable sustenance
And as for those who strive to oppose Our communications they shall be the inmates of the flaming fire
And We did not send before you any apostle or prophet but when he desired the Shaitan made a suggestion respecting his desire but Allah annuls that which the Shaitan casts then does Allah establish His communications and Allah is Knowing Wise
So that He may make what the Shaitan casts a trial for those in whose hearts is disease and those whose hearts are hard and most surely the unjust are in a great opposition
And that those who have been given the knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord so they may believe in it and their hearts may be lowly before it and most surely Allah is the Guide of those who believe into a right path
And those who disbelieve shall not cease to be in doubt concerning it until the hour overtakes them suddenly or there comes on them the chastisement of a destructive day
The kingdom on that day shall be Allah s He will judge between them so those who believe and do good will be in gardens of bliss
And as for those who disbelieve in and reject Our communications these it is who shall have a disgraceful chastisement
And as for those who fly in Allah s way and are then slain or die Allah will most certainly grant them a goodly sustenance and most surely Allah is the best Giver of sustenance
He will certainly cause them to enter a place of entrance which they shall be well pleased with and most surely Allah is Knowing Forbearing
That shall be so and he who retaliates with the like of that with which he has been afflicted and he has been oppressed Allah will most certainly aid him most surely Allah is Pardoning Forgiving
That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the day and causes the day to enter into the night and because Allah is Hearing Seeing
That is because Allah is the Truth and that what they call upon besides Him that is the falsehood and because Allah is the High the Great
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud so the earth becomes green
Surely Allah is Benignant Aware
His is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and most surely Allah is the Selfsufficient the Praised
Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you whatsoever is in the earth and the ships running in the sea by His command
And He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except with His permission most surely Allah is Compassionate Merciful to men
And He it is Who has brought you to life then He will cause you to die then bring you to life again most surely man is ungrateful
To every nation We appointed acts of devotion which they observe therefore they should not dispute with you about the matter and call to your Lord most surely you are on a right way
And if they contend with you say Allah best knows what you do
Allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection respecting that in which you differ
Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the heaven and the earth
Surely this is in a book surely this is easy to Allah
And they serve besides Allah that for which He has not sent any authority and that of which they have no knowledge and for the unjust there shall be no helper
And when Our clear communications are recited to them you will find denial on the faces of those who disbelieve they almost spring upon those who recite to them Our communications Say Shall I inform you of what is worse than this The fire Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve and how evil the resort
O people a parable is set forth therefore listen to it surely those whom you call upon besides Allah cannot create fly though they should all gather for it and should the fly snatch away anything from them they could not take it back from it weak are the invoker and the invoked
They have not estimated Allah with the estimation that i due to Him most surely Allah is Strong Mighty
Allah chooses apostles from among the angels and from among the men surely Allah is Hearing Seeing
He knows what is before them and what is behind them and to Allah are all affairs turned back
O you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves and serve your Lord and do good that you may succeed
And strive hard in the way of Allah such a striving as is due to Him He has chosen you and has not laid upon you an hardship in religion the faith of your father Ibrahim He named you Muslims before and in this that the Apostle may be a bearer of witness to you and you may be bearers of witness to the people therefore keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and hold fast by Allah He is your Guardian how excellent the Guardian and how excellent the Helper
Successful indeed are the believers
Who are humble in their prayers
And who keep aloof from what is vain
And who are givers of poorrate
And who guard their private parts
Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess for they surely are not blameable
But whoever seeks to go beyond that these are they that exceed the limits
And those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant
And those who keep a guard on their prayers
These are they who are the heirs
Who shall inherit the Paradise they shall abide therein
And certainly We created man of an extract of clay
Then We made him a small seed in a firm restingplace
Then We made the seed a clot then We made the clot a lump of flesh then We made in the lump of flesh bones then We clothed the bones with flesh then We caused it to grow into another creation so blessed be Allah the best of the creators
Then after that you will most surely die
Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be raised
And certainly We made above you seven heavens and never are We heedless of creation
And We send down water from the cloud according to a measure then We cause it to settle in the earth and most surely We are able to carry it away
Then We cause to grow thereby gardens of palm trees and grapes for you you have in them many fruits and from them do you eat
And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat
And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle We make you to drink of what is in their bellies and you have in them many advantages and of them you eat
And on them and on the ships you are borne
And certainly We sent Nuh to his people and he said O my people serve Allah you have no god other than Him will you not then guard against evil
And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who desires that he may have superiority over you and if Allah had pleased He could certainly have sent down angels
We have not heard of this among our fathers of yore
He is only a madman so bear with him for a time
He said O my Lord help me against their calling me a liar
So We revealed to him saying Make the ark before Our eyes and according to Our revelation and when Our command is given and the valley overflows take into it of every kind a pair two and your followers except those among them against whom the word has gone forth and do not speak to Me in respect of those who are unjust surely they shall be drowned
And when you are firmly seated you and those with you in the ark say All praise is due to Allah who delivered us from the unjust people
And say O my Lord cause me to disembark a blessed alighting and Thou art the best to cause to alight
Most surely there are signs in this and most surely We are ever trying men
Then We raised up after them another generation
So We sent among them an apostle from among them saying Serve Allah you have no god other than Him will you not then guard against evil
And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called the meeting of the hereafter a lie and whom We had given plenty to enjoy in this world s life said This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves eating of what you eat from and drinking of what you drink
And if you obey a mortal like yourselves then most surely you will be losers
What does he threaten you that when you are dead and become dust and bones that you shall then be brought forth
Far far is that which you are threatened with
There is naught but our life in this world we die and we live and we shall not be raised again
He is naught but a man who has forged a lie against Allah and we are not going to believe in him
He said O my Lord help me against their calling me a liar
He said In a little while they will most certainly be repenting
So the punishment overtook them in justice and We made them as rubbish so away with the unjust people
Then We raised after them other generations
No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone it
Then We sent Our apostles one after another whenever there came to a people their apostle they called him a liar so We made some of them follow others and We made them stories so away with a people who do not believe
Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun with Our communications and a clear authority
To Firon and his chiefs but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people
And they said What shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people serve us
So they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed
And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow a right direction
And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign and We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and springs
O apostles eat of the good things and do good surely I know what you do
And surely this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord therefore be careful of your duty to Me
But they cut off their religion among themselves into sects each part rejoicing in that which is with them
Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance till
Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth and children
We are hastening to them of good things
Nay they do not perceive
Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious
And those who believe in the communications of their Lord
And those who do not associate aught with their Lord
And those who give what they give in alms while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return
These hasten to good things and they are foremost in attaining them
And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent of its ability and with Us is a book which speaks the truth and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
Nay their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which they do
Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among them with punishment lo they cry for succor
Cry not for succor this day surely you shall not be given help from Us
My communications were indeed recited to you but you used to turn back on your heels
In arrogance talking nonsense about the Quran and left him like one telling fables by night
Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said or is it that there has come to them that which did not come to their fathers of old
Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle so that they deny him
Or do they say There is madness in him
Nay he has brought them the truth and most of them are averse from the truth
And should the truth follow their low desires surely the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein would have perished
Nay We have brought to them their reminder but from their reminder they turn aside
Or is it that you ask them a recompense
But the recompense of your Lord is best and He is the best of those who provide sustenance
And most surely you invite them to a right way
And most surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way
And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress they have they would persist in their inordinacy blindly wandering on
And already We overtook them with chastisement but they were not submissive to their Lord nor do they humble themselves
Until when We open upon them a door of severe chastisement lo they are in despair at it
And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts little is it that you give thanks
And He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered
And He it is Who gives life and causes death and in His control is the alternation of the night and the day do you not then understand
Nay they say the like of what the ancients said
They say What When we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then be raised
Certainly we are promised this and so were our fathers aforetime this is naught but stories of those of old
Say Whose is the earth and whoever is therein if you know
They will say Allah s
Say Will you not then mind
Say Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the mighty dominion
They will say This is Allah s
Say Will you not then guard against evil
Say Who is it in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things and Who gives succor but against Him Succor is not given if you do but know
They will say This is Allah s
Say From whence are you then deceived
Nay We have brought to them the truth and most surely they are liars
Never did Allah take to Himself a son and never was there with him any other god in that case would each god have certainly taken away what he created and some of them would certainly have overpowered others glory be to Allah above what they describe
The Knower of the unseen and the seen so may He be exalted above what they associate with Him
Say O my Lord if Thou shouldst make me see what they are threatened with
My Lord then place me not with the unjust
And most surely We are well able to make you see what We threaten them with
Repel evil by what is best We know best what they describe
And say O my Lord
I seek refuge in Thee from the evil suggestions of the Shaitans
And I seek refuge in Thee O my Lord from their presence
Until when death overtakes one of them he says Send me back my Lord send me back
Haply I may do good in that which I have left
By no means it is a mere word that he speaks and before them is a barrier until the day they are raised
So when the trumpet is blown there shall be no ties of relationship between them on that day nor shall they ask of each other
Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant these are the successful
And as for him whose good deeds are light these are they who shall have lost their souls abiding in hell
The fire shall scorch their faces and they therein shall be in severe affliction
Were not My communications recited to you
But you used to reject them
They shall say O our Lord our adversity overcame us and we were an erring people
O our Lord
Take us out of it then if we return to evil surely we shall be unjust
He shall say Go away into it and speak not to Me
Surely there was a party of My servants who said O our Lord we believe so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on us and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones
But you took them for a mockery until they made you forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them
Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were patient that they are the achievers
He will say How many years did you tarry in the earth
They will say We tarried a day or part of a day but ask those who keep account
He will say You did tarry but a little had you but known it
What did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us
So exalted be Allah the True King no god is there but He the Lord of the honorable dominion
And whoever invokes with Allah another god he has no proof of this his reckoning is only with his Lord surely the unbelievers shall not be successful
And say O my Lord forgive and have mercy and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones
This is a chapter which We have revealed and made obligatory and in which We have revealed clear communications that you may be mindful
As for the fornicatress and the fornicator flog each of them giving a hundred stripes and let not pity for them detain you in the matter of obedience to Allah if you believe in Allah and the last day and let a party of believers witness their chastisement
The fornicator shall not marry any but a fornicatress or idolatress and as for the fornicatress none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolater and it is forbidden to the believers
And those who accuse free women then do not bring four witnesses flog them giving eighty stripes and do not admit any evidence from them ever and these it is that are the transgressors
Except those who repent after this and act aright for surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And as for those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves the evidence of one of these should be taken four times bearing Allah to witness that he is most surely of the truthful ones
And the fifth time that the curse of Allah be on him if he is one of the liars
And it shall avert the chastisement from her if she testify four times bearing Allah to witness that he is most surely one of the liars
And the fifth time that the wrath of Allah be on her if he is one of the truthful
And were it not for Allah s grace upon you and His mercy and that Allah is Oftreturning to mercy Wise
Surely they who concocted the lie are a party from among you
Do not regard it an evil to you nay it is good for you
Every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin and as for him who took upon himself the main part thereof he shall have a grievous chastisement
Why did not the believing men and the believing women when you heard it think well of their own people and say This is an evident falsehood
Why did they not bring four witnesses of it
But as they have not brought witnesses they are liars before Allah
And were it not for Allah s grace upon you and His mercy in this world and the hereafter a grievous chastisement would certainly have touched you on account of the discourse which you entered into
When you received it with your tongues and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of and you deemed it an easy matter while with Allah it was grievous
And why did you not when you heard it say It does not beseem us that we should talk of it glory be to Thee this is a great calumny
Allah admonishes you that you should not return to the like of it ever again if you are believers
And Allah makes clear to you the communications and Allah is Knowing Wise
Surely as for those who love that scandal should circulate respecting those who believe they shall have a grievous chastisement in this world and the hereafter and Allah knows while you do not know
And were it not for Allah s grace on you and His mercy and that Allah is Compassionate Merciful
O you who believe do not follow the footsteps of the Shaitan and whoever follows the footsteps of the Shaitan then surely he bids the doing of indecency and evil and were it not for Allah s grace upon you and His mercy not one of you would have ever been pure but Allah purifies whom He pleases and Allah is Hearing Knowing
And let not those of you who possess grace and abundance swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those who have fled in Allah s way and they should pardon and turn away
Do you not love that Allah should forgive you
And Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Surely those who accuse chaste believing women unaware of the evil are cursed in this world and the hereafter and they shall have a grievous chastisement
On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall bear witness against them as to what they did
On that day Allah will pay back to them in full their just reward and they shall know that Allah is the evident Truth
Unclean things are for unclean ones and unclean ones are for unclean things and the good things are for good ones and the good ones are for good things these are free from what they say they shall have forgiveness and an honorable sustenance
O you who believe
Do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked permission and saluted their inmates this is better for you that you may be mindful
But if you do not find any one therein then do not enter them until permission is given to you and if it is said to you Go back then go back this is purer for you and Allah is Cognizant of what you do
It is no sin in you that you enter uninhabited houses wherein you have your necessaries and Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide
Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts that is purer for them surely Allah is Aware of what they do
And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof and let them wear their headcoverings over their bosoms and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers or the fathers of their husbands or their sons or the sons of their husbands or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or those whom their right hands possess or the male servants not having need of women or the children who have not attained knowledge of what is hidden of women and let them not strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may be known and turn to Allah all of you O believers so that you may be successful
And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves if they are needy Allah will make them free from want out of His grace and Allah is Amplegiving Knowing
And let those who do not find the means to marry keep chaste until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace And as for those who ask for a writing from among those whom your right hands possess give them the writing if you know any good in them and give them of the wealth of Allah which He has given you and do not compel your slave girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail good of this world s life and whoever compels them then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And certainly We have sent to you clear communications and a description of those who have passed away before you and an admonition to those who guard against evil
Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth a likeness of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp the lamp is in a glass and the glass is as it were a brightly shining star lit from a blessed olivetree neither eastern nor western the oil whereof almost gives light though fire touch it not light upon light Allah guides to His light whom He pleases and Allah sets forth parables for men and Allah is Cognizant of all things
In houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and that His name may be remembered in them there glorify Him therein in the mornings and the evenings
Men whom neither merchandise nor selling diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of poorrate they fear a day in which the hearts and eyes shall turn about
That Allah may give them the best reward of what they have done and give them more out of His grace and Allah gives sustenance to whom He pleases without measure
And as for those who disbelieve their deeds are like the mirage in a desert which the thirsty man deems to be water until when he comes to it he finds it to be naught and there he finds Allah so He pays back to him his reckoning in full and Allah is quick in reckoning
Or like utter darkness in the deep sea there covers it a wave above which is another wave above which is a cloud layers of utter darkness one above another when he holds out his hand he is almost unable to see it and to whomsoever Allah does not give light he has no light
Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all those who are in the heavens and the earth and the very birds with expanded wings
He knows the prayer of each one and its glorification and Allah is Cognizant of what they do
And Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to Allah is the eventual coming
Do you not see that Allah drives along the clouds then gathers them together then piles them up so that you see the rain coming forth from their midst
And He sends down of the clouds that are like mountains wherein is hail afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases the flash of His lightning almost takes away the sight
Allah turns over the night and the day most surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight
And Allah has created from water every living creature so of them is that which walks upon its belly and of them is that which walks upon two feet and of them is that which walks upon four Allah creates what He pleases surely Allah has power over all things
Certainly We have revealed clear communications and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right way
And they say We believe in Allah and in the apostle and we obey then a party of them turn back after this and these are not believers
And when they are called to Allah and His Apostle that he may judge between them lo a party of them turn aside
And if the truth be on their side they come to him quickly obedient
Is there in their hearts a disease or are they in doubt or do they fear that Allah and His Apostle will act wrongfully towards them
Nay they themselves are the unjust
The response of the believers when they are invited to Allah and His Apostle that he may judge between them is only to say We hear and we obey and these it is that are the successful
And he who obeys Allah and His Apostle and fears Allah and is careful of his duty to Him these it is that are the achievers
And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their oaths that if you command them they would certainly go forth
Say Swear not reasonable obedience is desired surely Allah is aware of what you do
Say Obey Allah and obey the Apostle but if you turn back then on him rests that which is imposed on him and on you rests that which is imposed on you and if you obey him you are on the right way and nothing rests on the Apostle but clear delivering of the message
Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them and that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them and that He will most certainly after their fear give them security in exchange they shall serve Me not associating aught with Me and whoever is ungrateful after this these it is who are the transgressors
And keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and obey the Apostle so that mercy may be shown to you
Think not that those who disbelieve shall escape in the earth and their abode is the fire and certainly evil is the resort
O you who believe let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times before the morning prayer and when you put off your clothes at midday in summer and after the prayer of the nightfall these are three times of privacy for you neither is it a sin for you nor for them besides these some of you must go round about waiting upon others thus does Allah make clear to you the communications and Allah is Knowing Wise
And when the children among you have attained to puberty let them seek permission as those before them sought permission thus does Allah make clear to you His communications and Allah is knowing Wise
And as for women advanced in years who do not hope for a marriage it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their ornaments and if they restrain themselves it is better for them and Allah is Hearing Knowing
There is no blame on the blind man nor is there blame on the lame nor is there blame on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses or your fathers houses or your mothers houses or your brothers houses or your sisters houses or your paternal uncles houses or your paternal aunts houses or your maternal uncles houses or your maternal aunts houses or what you possess the keys of or your friends houses
It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately
So when you enter houses greet your people with a salutation from Allah blessed and goodly thus does Allah make clear to you the communications that you may understand
Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His Apostle and when they are with him on a momentous affair they go not away until they have asked his permission surely they who ask your permission are they who believe in Allah and His Apostle so when they ask your permission for some affair of theirs give permission to whom you please of them and ask forgiveness for them from Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Do not hold the Apostle s calling you among you to be like your calling one to the other Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you concealing themselves therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement
Now surely Allah s is whatever is in the heavens and the earth He knows indeed that to which you are conforming yourselves and on the day on which they are returned to Him He will inform them of what they did and Allah is Cognizant of all things
Blessed is He Who sent down the Furqan upon His servant that he may be a warner to the nations
He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and Who did not take to Himself a son and Who has no associate in the kingdom and Who created everything then ordained for it a measure
And they have taken besides Him gods who do not create anything while they are themselves created and they control not for themselves any harm or profit and they control not death nor life nor raising the dead to life
And those who disbelieve say This is nothing but a lie which he has forged and other people have helped him at it so indeed they have done injustice and uttered a falsehood
And they say The stories of the ancients he has got them written so these are read out to him morning and evening
Say He has revealed it Who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth surely He is ever Forgiving Merciful
And they say What is the matter with this Apostle that he eats food and goes about in the markets why has not an angel been sent down to him so that he should have been a warner with him
Or why is not a treasure sent down to him or he is made to have a garden from which he should eat
And the unjust say You do not follow any but a man deprived of reason
See what likenesses do they apply to you so they have gone astray therefore they shall not be able to find a way
Blessed is He Who if He please will give you what is better than this gardens beneath which rivers flow and He will give you palaces
But they reject the hour and We have prepared a burning fire for him who rejects the hour
When it shall come into their sight from a distant place they shall hear its vehement raging and roaring
And when they are cast into a narrow place in it bound they shall there call out for destruction
Call not this day for one destruction but call for destructions many
Say Is this better or the abiding garden which those who guard against evil are promised That shall be a reward and a resort for them
They shall have therein what they desire abiding in it it is a promise which it is proper to be prayed for from your Lord
And on the day when He shall gather them and whatever they served besides Allah He shall say Was it you who led astray these My servants or did they themselves go astray from the path
They shall say Glory be to Thee it was not beseeming for us that we should take any guardians besides Thee but Thou didst make them and their fathers to enjoy until they forsook the reminder and they were a people in perdition
So they shall indeed give you the lie in what you say then you shall not be able to ward off or help and whoever among you is unjust We will make him taste a great chastisement
And We have not sent before you any apostles but they most surely ate food and went about in the markets and We have made some of you a trial for others will you bear patiently And your Lord is ever Seeing
And those who do not hope for Our meeting say Why have not angels been sent down upon us or why do we not see our Lord
Now certainly they are too proud of themselves and have revolted in great revolt
On the day when they shall see the angels there shall be no joy on that day for the guilty and they shall say It is a forbidden thing totally prohibited
And We will proceed to what they have done of deeds so We shall render them as scattered floating dust
The dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in a better abidingplace and a better restingplace
And on the day when the heaven shall burst asunder with the clouds and the angels shall be sent down descending in ranks
The kingdom on that day shall rightly belong to the Beneficent Allah and a hard day shall it be for the unbelievers
And the day when the unjust one shall bite his hands saying O would that I had taken a way with the Apostle
O woe is me would that I had not taken such a one for a friend
Certainly he led me astray from the reminder after it had come to me and the Shaitan fails to aid man
And the Apostle cried out O my Lord surely my people have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing
And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the sinners and sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and a Helper
And those who disbelieve say Why has not the Quran been revealed to him all at once
Thus that We may strengthen your heart by it and We have arranged it well in arranging
And they shall not bring to you any argument but We have brought to you one with truth and best in significance
As for those who shall be gathered upon their faces to hell they are in a worse plight and straying farther away from the path
And certainly We gave Musa the Book and We appointed with him his brother Haroun an aider
Then We said Go you both to the people who rejected Our communications so We destroyed them with utter destruction
And the people of Nuh when they rejected the apostles We drowned them and made them a sign for men and We have prepared a painful punishment for the unjust
And Ad and Samood and the dwellers of the Rass and many generations between them
And to every one We gave examples and every one did We destroy with utter destruction
And certainly they have often passed by the town on which was rained an evil rain did they not then see it
Nay they did not hope to be raised again
And when they see you they do not take you for aught but a mockery Is this he whom Allah has raised to be an apostle
He had wellnigh led us astray from our gods had we not adhered to them patiently
And they will know when they see the punishment who is straying farther off from the path
Have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god Will you then be a protector over him
Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand
They are nothing but as cattle nay they are straying farther off from the path
Have you not considered the work of your Lord how He extends the shade
And if He had pleased He would certainly have made it stationary then We have made the sun an indication of it
Then We take it to Ourselves taking little by little
And He it is Who made the night a covering for you and the sleep a rest and He made the day to rise up again
And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy and We send down pure water from the cloud
That We may give life thereby to a dead land and give it for drink out of what We have created to cattle and many people
And certainly We have repeated this to them that they may be mindful but the greater number of men do not consent to aught except denying
And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a warner in every town
So do not follow the unbelievers and strive against them a mighty striving with it
And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely the one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness and the other salt that burns by its saltness and between the two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction
And He it is Who has created man from the water then He has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship and your Lord is powerful
And they serve besides Allah that which neither profits them nor causes them harm and the unbeliever is a partisan against his Lord
And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and as a warner
Say I do not ask you aught in return except that he who will may take the way to his Lord
And rely on the Everliving Who dies not and celebrate His praise and Sufficient is He as being aware of the faults of His servants
Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and He is firmly established on the throne of authority the Beneficent Allah so ask respecting it one aware
And when it is said to them Prostrate to the Beneficent Allah they say And what is the Allah of beneficence
Shall we prostrate to what you bid us
And it adds to their aversion
Blessed is He Who made the constellations in the heavens and made therein a lamp and a shining moon
And He it is Who made the night and the day to follow each other for him who desires to be mindful or desires to be thankful
And the servants of the Beneficent Allah are they who walk on the earth in humbleness and when the ignorant address them they say Peace
And they who pass the night prostrating themselves before their Lord and standing
And they who say O our Lord turn away from us the punishment of hell surely the punishment thereof is a lasting
Surely it is an evil abode and evil place to stay
And they who when they spend are neither extravagant nor parsimonious and keep between these the just mean
And they who do not call upon another god with Allah and do not slay the soul which Allah has forbidden except in the requirements of justice and who do not commit fornication and he who does this shall find a requital of sin
The punishment shall be doubled to him on the day of resurrection and he shall abide therein in abasement
Except him who repents and believes and does a good deed so these are they of whom Allah changes the evil deeds to good ones and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And whoever repents and does good he surely turns to Allah a goodly turning
And they who do not bear witness to what is false and when they pass by what is vain they pass by nobly
And they who when reminded of the communications of their Lord do not fall down thereat deaf and blind
And they who say O our Lord grant us in our wives and our offspring the joy of our eyes and make us guides to those who guard against evil
These shall be rewarded with high places because they were patient and shall be met therein with greetings and salutations
Abiding therein goodly the abode and the restingplace
Say My Lord would not care for you were it not for your prayer but you have indeed rejected the truth so that which shall cleave shall come
Ta Sin Mim
These are the verses of the Book that makes things clear
Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe
If We please We should send down upon them a sign from the heaven so that their necks should stoop to it
And there does not come to them a new reminder from the Beneficent Allah but they turn aside from it
So they have indeed rejected the truth therefore the news of that which they mock shall soon come to them
Do they not see the earth how many of every noble kind We have caused to grow in it
Most surely there is a sign in that but most of them will not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
And when your Lord called out to Musa saying Go to the unjust people
The people of Firon Will they not guard against evil
He said O my Lord surely I fear that they will reject me
And by breast straitens and my tongue is not eloquent therefore send Thou to Haroun to help me
And they have a crime against me therefore I fear that they may slay me
He said By no means so go you both with Our signs surely We are with you hearing
Then come to Firon and say Surely we are the apostles of the Lord of the worlds
Then send with us the children of Israel
Firon said Did we not bring you up as a child among us and you tarried among us for many years of your life
And you did that deed of yours which you did and you are one of the ungrateful
He said I did it then while I was of those unable to see the right course
So I fled from you when I feared you then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me of the apostles
And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have enslaved the children of Israel
Firon said And what is the Lord of the worlds
He said The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them if you would be sure
Firon said to those around him Do you not hear
He said Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old
Said he Most surely your Apostle who is sent to you is mad
He said The Lord of the east and the west and what is between them if you understand
Said he If you will take a god besides me I will most certainly make you one of the imprisoned
He said What even if I bring to you something manifest
Said he Bring it then if you are of the truthful ones
So he cast down his rod and lo it was an obvious serpent
And he drew forth his hand and lo it appeared white to the onlookers
Firon said to the chiefs around him Most surely this is a skillful magician
Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic what is it then that you advise
They said Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities
That they should bring to you every skillful magician
So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed time on the fixed day
And it was said to the people Will you gather together
Haply we may follow the magicians if they are the vanquishers
And when the magicians came they said to Firon Shall we get a reward if we are the vanquishers
He said Yes and surely you will then be of those who are made near
Musa said to them Cast what you are going to cast
So they cast down their cords and their rods and said By Firon s power we shall most surely be victorious
Then Musa cast down his staff and lo it swallowed up the lies they told
And the magicians were thrown down prostrate
They said We believe in the Lord of the worlds
The Lord of Musa and Haroun
Said he You believe in him before I give you permission most surely he is the chief of you who taught you the magic so you shall know certainly I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and certainly I will crucify you all
They said No harm surely to our Lord we go back
Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers
And We revealed to Musa saying Go away with My servants travelling by night surely you will be pursued
So Firon sent heralds into the cities
Most surely these are a small company
And most surely they have enraged us
And most surely we are a vigilant multitude
So We turned them out of gardens and springs
And treasures and goodly dwellings
Even so And We gave them as a heritage to the children of Israel
Then they pursued them at sunrise
So when the two hosts saw each other the companions of Musa cried out Most surely we are being overtaken
He said By no means surely my Lord is with me He will show me a way out
Then We revealed to Musa Strike the sea with your staff
So it had cloven asunder and each part was like a huge mound
And We brought near there the others
And We saved Musa and those with him all of them
Then We drowned the others
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
And recite to them the story of Ibrahim
When he said to his father and his people What do you worship
They said We worship idols so we shall be their votaries
He said Do they hear you when you call
Or do they profit you or cause you harm
They said Nay we found our fathers doing so
He said Have you then considered what you have been worshipping
You and your ancient sires
Surely they are enemies to me but not so the Lord of the worlds
Who created me then He has shown me the way
And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink
And when I am sick then He restores me to health
And He Who will cause me to die then give me life
And Who I hope will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment
My Lord Grant me wisdom and join me with the good
And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity
And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss
And forgive my father for surely he is of those who have gone astray
And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised
The day on which property will not avail nor sons
Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free from evil
And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard against evil
And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones
And it shall be said to them Where are those that you used to worship
Besides Allah
Can they help you or yet help themselves
So they shall be thrown down into it they and the erring ones
And the hosts of the Shaitan all
They shall say while they contend therein
By Allah we were certainly in manifest error
When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds
And none but the guilty led us astray
So we have no intercessors
Nor a true friend
But if we could but once return we would be of the believers
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
The people of Nuh rejected the apostles
When their brother Nuh said to them Will you not guard against evil
Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you any reward for it my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
So guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
They said Shall we believe in you while the meanest follow you
He said And what knowledge have I of what they do
Their account is only with my Lord if you could perceive
And I am not going to drive away the believers
I am naught but a plain warner
They said If you desist not O Nuh you shall most certainly be of those stoned to death
He said My Lord
Surely my people give me the lie
Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a just judgment and deliver me and those who are with me of the believers
So We delivered him and those with him in the laden ark
Then We drowned the rest afterwards
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
Ad gave the lie to the apostles
When their brother Hud said to them Will you not guard against evil
Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you any reward for it surely my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
Do you build on every height a monument Vain is it that you do
And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may
And when you lay hands on men you lay hands like tyrants
So guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And be careful of your duty to Him Who has given you abundance of what you know
He has given you abundance of cattle and children
And gardens and fountains
Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day
They said It is the same to us whether you admonish or are not one of the admonishers
This is naught but a custom of the ancients
And we are not going to be punished
So they gave him the lie then We destroyed them
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
Samood gave the lie to the apostles
When their brother Salih said to them Will you not guard against evil
Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you any reward for it my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
Will you be left secure in what is here
In gardens and fountains
And cornfields and palmtrees having fine spadices
And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant
Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright
They said You are only of the deluded ones
You are naught but a mortal like ourselves so bring a sign if you are one of the truthful
He said This is a shecamel she shall have her portion of water and you have your portion of water on an appointed time
And do not touch her with evil lest the punishment of a grievous day should overtake you
But they hamstrung her then regretted
So the punishment overtook them
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles
When their brother Lut said to them Will you not guard against evil
Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you any reward for it my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
What do you come to the males from among the creatures
And leave what your Lord has created for you of your wives
Nay you are a people exceeding limits
They said If you desist not O Lut you shall surely be of those who are expelled
He said Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your doing
My Lord deliver me and my followers from what they do
So We delivered him and his followers all
Except an old woman among those who remained behind
Then We utterly destroyed the others
And We rained down upon them a rain and evil was the rain on those warned
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is the Mighty the Merciful
The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the apostles
When Shu aib said to them Will you not guard against evil
Surely I am a faithful apostle to you
Therefore guard against the punishment of Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you any reward for it my reward is only with the Lord of the worlds
Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish
And weigh things with a right balance
And do not wrong men of their things and do not act corruptly in the earth making mischief
And guard against the punishment of Him who created you and the former nations
They said You are only of those deluded
And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves and we know you to be certainly of the liars
Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down upon us if you are one of the truthful
He said My Lord knows best what you do
But they called him a liar so the punishment of the day of covering overtook them surely it was the punishment of a grievous day
Most surely there is a sign in this but most of them do not believe
And most surely your Lord is Mighty the Merciful
And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
The Faithful Spirit has descended with it
Upon your heart that you may be of the warners
In plain Arabic language
And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients
Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the Israelites know it
And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners
So that he should have recited it to them they would not have believed therein
Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the guilty
They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
And it shall come to them all of a sudden while they shall not perceive
Then they will say Shall we be respited
What do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment
Have you then considered if We let them enjoy themselves for years
Then there comes to them that with which they are threatened
That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail them
And We did not destroy any town but it had its warners
To remind and We are never unjust
And the Shaitans have not come down with it
And it behoves them not and they have not the power to do it
Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it
So call not upon another god with Allah lest you be of those who are punished
And warn your nearest relations
And be kind to him who follows you of the believers
But if they disobey you then say Surely I am clear of what you do
And rely on the Mighty the Merciful
Who sees you when you stand up
And your turning over and over among those who prostrate themselves before Allah
Surely He is the Hearing the Knowing
Shall I inform you of him upon whom the Shaitans descend
They descend upon every lying sinful one
They incline their ears and most of them are liars
And as to the poets those who go astray follow them
Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley
And that they say that which they do not do
Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah much and defend themselves after they are oppressed and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back
Ta Sin
These are the verses of the Quran and the Book that makes things clear
A guidance and good news for the believers
Who keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and of the hereafter they are sure
As to those who do not believe in the hereafter We have surely made their deeds fairseeming to them but they blindly wander on
These are they who shall have an evil punishment and in the hereafter they shall be the greatest losers
And most surely you are made to receive the Quran from the Wise the Knowing Allah
When Musa said to his family Surely I see fire I will bring to you from it some news or I will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so that you may warm yourselves
So when he came to it a voice was uttered saying Blessed is Whoever is in the fire and whatever is about it and glory be to Allah the Lord of the worlds
O Musa surely I am Allah the Mighty the Wise
And cast down your staff So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent he turned back retreating and did not return O Musa fear not surely the apostles shall not fear in My presence
Neither he who has been unjust then he does good instead after evil for surely I am the Forgiving the Merciful
And enter your hand into the opening of your bosom it shall come forth white without evil among nine signs to Firon and his people surely they are a transgressing people
So when Our clear signs came to them they said This is clear enchantment
And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their soul had been convinced of them consider then how was the end of the mischiefmakers
And certainly We gave knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman and they both said Praise be to Allah Who has made us to excel many of His believing servants
And Sulaiman was Dawood s heir and he said O men we have been taught the language of birds and we have been given all things most surely this is manifest grace
And his hosts of the jinn and the men and the birds were gathered to him and they were formed into groups
Until when they came to the valley of the Naml a Namlite said O Naml enter your houses that Sulaiman and his hosts may not crush you while they do not know
So he smiled wondering at her word and said My Lord grant me that I should be grateful for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents and that I should do good such as Thou art pleased with and make me enter by Thy mercy into Thy servants the good ones
And he reviewed the birds then said How is it I see not the hoopoe or is it that he is of the absentees
I will most certainly punish him with a severe punishment or kill him or he shall bring to me a clear plea
And he tarried not long then said I comprehend that which you do not comprehend and I have brought to you a sure information from Sheba
Surely I found a woman ruling over them and she has been given abundance and she has a mighty throne
I found her and her people adoring the sun instead of Allah and the Shaitan has made their deeds fairseeming to them and thus turned them from the way so they do not go aright
That they do not make obeisance to Allah Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide and what you make manifest
Allah there is no god but He He is the Lord of mighty power
He said We will see whether you have told the truth or whether you are of the liars
Take this my letter and hand it over to them then turn away from them and see what answer they return
She said O chief surely an honorable letter has been delivered to me
Surely it is from Sulaiman and surely it is in the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful
Saying exalt not yourselves against me and come to me in submission
She said O chiefs give me advice respecting my affair I never decide an affair until you are in my presence
They said We are possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess and the command is yours therefore see what you will command
She said Surely the kings when they enter a town ruin it and make the noblest of its people to be low and thus they always do
And surely I am going to send a present to them and shall wait to see what answer do the apostles bring back
So when he came to Sulaiman he said What will you help me with wealth
But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you
Nay you are exultant because of your present
Go back to them so we will most certainly come to them with hosts which they shall have no power to oppose and we will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement and they shall be in a state of ignominy
He said O chiefs which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission
One audacious among the jinn said I will bring it to you before you rise up from your place and most surely I am strong and trusty for it
One who had the knowledge of the Book said I will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye Then when he saw it settled beside him he said This is of the grace of my Lord that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful and whoever is grateful he is grateful only for his own soul and whoever is ungrateful then surely my Lord is Selfsufficient Honored
He said Alter her throne for her we will see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright
So when she came it was said Is your throne like this
She said It is as it were the same and we were given the knowledge before it and we were submissive
And what she worshipped besides Allah prevented her surely she was of an unbelieving people
It was said to her Enter the palace but when she saw it she deemed it to be a great expanse of water and bared her legs
He said Surely it is a palace made smooth with glass
She said My Lord surely I have been unjust to myself and I submit with Sulaiman to Allah the Lord of the worlds
And certainly We sent to Samood their brother Salih saying Serve Allah and lo they became two sects quarrelling with each other
He said O my people why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good
Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that you may be dealt with mercifully
They said We have met with ill luck on account of you and on account of those with you
He said The cause of your evil fortune is with Allah nay you are a people who are tried
And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and did not act aright
They said Swear to each other by Allah that we will certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by night then we will say to his heir We did not witness the destruction of his family and we are most surely truthful
And they planned a plan and We planned a plan while they perceived not
See then how was the end of their plan that We destroyed them and their people all of them
So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust most surely there is a sign in this for a people who know
And We delivered those who believed and who guarded against evil
And We sent Lut when he said to his people What do you commit indecency while you see
What do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than women
Nay you are a people who act ignorantly
But the answer of his people was no other except that they s said Turn out Lut s followers from your town surely they are a people who would keep pure
But We delivered him and his followers except his wife We ordained her to be of those who remained behind
And We rained on them a rain and evil was the rain of those who had been warned
Say Praise be to Allah and peace on His servants whom He has chosen is Allah better or what they associate with Him
Nay He Who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from the cloud then We cause to grow thereby beautiful gardens it is not possible for you that you should make the trees thereof to grow
Is there a god with Allah
Nay they are people who deviate
Or Who made the earth a restingplace and made in it rivers and raised on it mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier
Is there a god with Allah
Nay most of them do not know
Or Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil and He will make you successors in the earth
Is there a god with Allah
Little is it that you mind
Or Who guides you in utter darkness of the land and the sea and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy
Is there a god with Allah
Exalted by Allah above what they associate with Him
Or Who originates the creation then reproduces it and Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth
Is there a god With Allah
Say Bring your proof if you are truthful
Say No one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen but Allah and they do not know when they shall be raised
Nay their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight and hasty nay they are in doubt about it nay they are quite blind to it
And those who disbelieve say What when we have become dust and our fathers too shall we certainly be brought forth
We have certainly been promised this we and our fathers before these are naught but stories of the ancients
Say Travel in the earth then see how was the end of the guilty
And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they plan
And they say When will this threat come to pass if you are truthful
Say Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of that which you seek to hasten on
And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men but most of them are not grateful
And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest
And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book
Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel most of what they differ in
And most surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers
Surely your Lord will judge between them by his judgment and He is the Mighty the knowing
Therefore rely on Allah surely you are on the clear truth
Surely you do not make the dead to hear and you do not make the deaf to hear the call when they go back retreating
Nor can you be a guide to the blind out of their error you cannot make to bear any one except those who believe in Our communications so they submit
And when the word shall come to pass against them We shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that shall wound them because people did not believe in Our communications
And on the day when We will gather from every nation a party from among those who rejected Our communications then they shall be formed into groups
Until when they come He will say Did you reject My communications while you had no comprehensive knowledge of them
Or what was it that you did
And the word shall come to pass against them because they were unjust so they shall not speak
Do they not consider that We have made the night that they may rest therein and the day to give light
Most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
And on the day when the trumpet shall be blown then those who are in the heavens and those who are in the earth shall be terrified except such as Allah please and all shall come to him abased
And you see the mountains you think them to be solid and they shall pass away as the passing away of the cloud the handiwork of Allah Who has made every thing thoroughly surely He is Aware of what you do
Whoever brings good he shall have better than it and they shall be secure from terror on the day
And whoever brings evil these shall be thrown down on their faces into the fire shall you be rewarded for aught except what you did
I am commanded only that I should serve the Lord of this city Who has made it sacred and His are all things and I am commanded that I should be of these who submit
And that I should recite the Quran Therefore whoever goes aright he goes aright for his own soul and whoever goes astray then say I am only one of the warners
And say Praise be to Allah He will show you His signs so that you shall recognize them nor is your Lord heedless of what you do
Ta sin Mim
These are the verses of the Book that makes things clear
We recite to you from the account of Musa and Firon with truth for people who believe
Surely Firon exalted himself in the land and made its people into parties weakening one party from among them he slaughtered their sons and let their women live surely he was one of the mischiefmakers
And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land and to make them the Imams and to make them the heirs
And to grant them power in the land and to make Firon and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared
And We revealed to Musa s mothers saying Give him suck then when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve surely We will bring him back to you and make him one of the apostles
And Firon s family took him up that he might be an enemy and a grief for them surely Firon and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers
And Firon s wife said A refreshment of the eye to me and to you do not slay him maybe he will be useful to us or we may take him for a son and they did not perceive
And the heart of Musa s mother was free from anxiety she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers
And she said to his sister Follow him up
So she watched him from a distance while they did not perceive
And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before so she said Shall I point out to you the people of a house who will take care of him for you and they will be benevolent to him
So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed and that she might no grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true but most of them do not know
And when he attained his maturity and became full grown We granted him wisdom and knowledge and thus do We reward those who do good to others
And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on the part of its people so he found therein two men fighting one being of his party and the other of his foes and he who was of his party cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies so Musa struck him with his fist and killed him He said This is on account of the Shaitan s doing surely he is an enemy openly leading astray
He said My Lord surely I have done harm to myself so do Thou protect me So He protected him surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful
He said My Lord because Thou hast bestowed a favor on me I shall never be a backer of the guilty
And he was in the city fearing awaiting when lo he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for aid
Musa said to him You are most surely one erring manifestly
So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both he said O Musa do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday
You desire nothing but that you should be a tyrant in the land and you do not desire to be of those who act aright
And a man came running from the remotest part of the city He said O Musa surely the chiefs are consulting together to slay you therefore depart at once surely I am of those who wish well to you
So he went forth therefrom fearing awaiting and he said My Lord deliver me from the unjust people
And when he turned his face towards Madyan he said Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path
And when he came to the water of Madyan he found on it a group of men watering and he found besides them two women keeping back their flocks
He said What is the matter with you
They said We cannot water until the shepherds take away their sheep from the water and our father is a very old man
So he watered their sheep for them then went back to the shade and said My Lord surely I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me
Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully
She said My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us
So when he came to him and gave to him the account he said Fear not you are secure from the unjust people
Said one of them O my father employ him surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man the faithful one
He said I desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight years but if you complete ten it will be of your own free will and I do not wish to be hard to you if Allah please you will find me one of the good
He said This shall be an agreement between me and you whichever of the two terms I fulfill there shall be no wrongdoing to me and Allah is a witness of what we say
So when Musa had fulfilled the term and he journeyed with his family he perceived on this side of the mountain a fire
He said to his family Wait I have seen a fire maybe I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves
And when he came to it a voice was uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush saying O Musa surely I am Allah the Lord of the worlds
And saying Cast down you staff
So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent he turned back retreating and did not return
O Musa come forward and fear not surely you are of those who are secure
Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom it will come forth white without evil and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear so these two shall be two arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs surely they are a transgressing people
He said My Lord surely I killed one of them so I fear lest they should slay me
And my brother Haroun he is more eloquent of tongue than I therefore send him with me as an aider verifying me surely I fear that they would reject me
He said We will strengthen your arm with your brother and We will give you both an authority so that they shall not reach you go with Our signs you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost
So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs they said This is nothing but forged enchantment and we never heard of it amongst our fathers of old
And Musa said My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him and whose shall be the good end of the abode surely the unjust shall not be successful
And Firon said O chiefs I do not know of any god for you besides myself therefore kindle a fire for me O Haman for brick then prepare for me a lofty building so that I may obtain knowledge of Musa s god and most surely I think him to be one of the liars
And he was unjustly proud in the land he and his hosts and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us
So We caught hold of him and his hosts then We cast them into the sea and see how was the end of the unjust
And We made them Imams who call to the fire and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted
And We caused a curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous
And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations clear arguments for men and a guidance and a mercy that they may be mindful
And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa the commandment and you were not among the witnesses
But We raised up generations then life became prolonged to them and you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan reciting to them Our communications but We were the senders
And you were not on this side of the mountain when We called but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you that they may be mindful
And were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before then they should say Our Lord why didst Thou not send to us an apostle so that we should have followed Thy communications and been of the believers
But now when the truth has come to them from Us they say Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa
What did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before They say Two magicians backing up each other and they say Surely we are unbelievers in all
Say Then bring some other book from Allah which is a better guide than both of them that I may follow it if you are truthful
But if they do not answer you then know that they only follow their low desires and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah
Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people
And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful
As to those whom We gave the Book before it they are believers in it
And when it is recited to them they say We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord surely we were submitters before this
These shall be granted their reward twice because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what We have given them
And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds peace be on you we do not desire the ignorant
Surely you cannot guide whom you love but Allah guides whom He pleases and He knows best the followers of the right way
And they say If we follow the guidance with you we shall be carried off from our country
What have We not settled them in a safe sacred territory to which fruits of every kind shall be drawn a sustenance from Us but most of them do not know
And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of subsistence so these are their abodes they have not been dwelt in after them except a little and We are the inheritors
And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised in their metropolis an apostle reciting to them Our communications and We never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust
And whatever things you have been given are only a provision of this world s life and its adornment and whatever is with Allah is better and more lasting do you not then understand
Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the provisions of this world s life then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up
And on the day when He will call them and say Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates
Those against whom the sentence has become confirmed will say Our Lord these are they whom we caused to err we caused them to err as we ourselves did err to Thee we declare ourselves to be clear of them they never served Us
And it will be said Call your associategods
So they will call upon them but they will not answer them and they shall see the punishment would that they had followed the right way
And on the day when He shall call them and say What was the answer you gave to the apostles
Then the pleas shall become obscure to them on that day so they shall not ask each other
But as to him who repents and believes and does good maybe he will be among the successful
And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases to choose is not theirs glory be to Allah and exalted be He above what they associate with Him
And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest
And He is Allah there is no god but He All praise is due to Him in this life and the hereafter and His is the judgment and to Him you shall be brought back
Say Tell me if Allah were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection who is the god besides Allah that could bring you light
Do you not then hear
Say Tell me if Allah were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection who is the god besides Allah that could bring you the night in which you take rest Do you not then see
And out of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His grace and that you may give thanks
And on the day when He shall call them and say Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates
And We will draw forth from among every nation a witness and say Bring your proof then shall they know that the truth is Allah s and that which they forged shall depart from them
Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa but he rebelled against them and We had given him of the treasures so much so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a company of men possessed of great strength When his people said to him Do not exult surely Allah does not love the exultant
And seek by means of what Allah has given you the future abode and do not neglect your portion of this world and do good to others as Allah has done good to you and do not seek to make mischief in the land surely Allah does not love the mischiefmakers
He said I have been given this only on account of the knowledge I have
Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him of the generations those who were mightier in strength than he and greater in assemblage
And the guilty shall not be asked about their faults
So he went forth to his people in his finery
Those who desire this world s life said O would that we had the like of what Qaroun is given most surely he is possessed of mighty good fortune
And those who were given the knowledge said Woe to you
Allah s reward is better for him who believes and does good and none is made to receive this except the patient
Thus We made the earth to swallow up him and his abode so he had no body of helpers to assist him against Allah nor was he of those who can defend themselves
And those who yearned for his place only the day before began to say Ah know that Allah amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants had not Allah been gracious to us He would most surely have abased us ah know that the ungrateful are never successful
As for that future abode We assign it to those who have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make mischief and the good end is for those who guard against evil
Whoever brings good he shall have better than it and whoever brings evil those who do evil shall not be rewarded for aught except what they did
Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you will bring you back to the destination
Say My Lord knows best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in manifest error
And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired to you but it is a mercy from your Lord therefore be not a backerup of the unbelievers
And let them not turn you aside from the communications of Allah after they have been revealed to you and call men to your Lord and be not of the polytheists
And call not with Allah any other god there is no god but He every thing is perishable but He His is the judgment and to Him you shall be brought back
Alif Lam Mim
Do men think that they will be left alone on saying We believe and not be tried
And certainly We tried those before them so Allah will certainly know those who are true and He will certainly know the liars
Or do they who work evil think that they will escape Us
Evil is it that they judge
Whoever hopes to meet Allah the term appointed by Allah will then most surely come and He is the Hearing the Knowing
And whoever strives hard he strives only for his own soul most surely Allah is Selfsufficient above need of the worlds
And as for those who believe and do good We will most certainly do away with their evil deeds and We will most certainly reward them the best of what they did
And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents and if they contend with you that you should associate others with Me of which you have no knowledge do not obey them to Me is your return so I will inform you of what you did
And as for those who believe and do good We will most surely cause them to enter among the good
And among men is he who says We believe in Allah but when he is persecuted in the way of Allah he thinks the persecution of men to be as the chastisement of Allah and if there come assistance from your Lord they would most certainly say Surely we were with you
What is not Allah the best knower of what is in the breasts of mankind
And most certainly Allah will know those who believe and most certainly He will know the hypocrites
And those who disbelieve say to those who believe Follow our path and we will bear your wrongs
And never shall they be the bearers of any of their wrongs most surely they are liars
And most certainly they shall carry their own burdens and other burdens with their own burdens and most certainly they shall be questioned on the resurrection day as to what they forged
And certainly We sent Nuh to his people so he remained among them a thousand years save fifty years
And the deluge overtook them while they were unjust
So We delivered him and the inmates of the ark and made it a sign to the nations
And We sent Ibrahim when he said to his people Serve Allah and be careful of your duty to Him this is best for you if you did but know
You only worship idols besides Allah and you create a lie surely they whom you serve besides Allah do not control for you any sustenance therefore seek the sustenance from Allah and serve Him and be grateful to Him to Him you shall be brought back
And if you reject the truth nations before you did indeed reject the truth and nothing is incumbent on the apostle but a plain delivering of the message
What do they not consider how Allah originates the creation then reproduces it Surely that is easy to Allah
Say Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first creation then Allah creates the latter creation surely Allah has power over all things
He punishes whom He pleases and has mercy on whom He pleases and to Him you shall be turned back
And you shall not escape in the earth nor in the heaven and you have neither a protector nor a helper besides Allah
And as to those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah and His meeting they have despaired of My mercy and these it is that shall have a painful punishment
So naught was the answer of his people except that they said Slay him or burn him then Allah delivered him from the fire most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
And he said You have only taken for yourselves idols besides Allah by way of friendship between you in this world s life then on the resurrection day some of you shall deny others and some of you shall curse others and your abode is the fire and you shall not have any helpers
And Lut believed in Him and he said I am fleeing to my Lord surely He is the Mighty the Wise
And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqoub and caused the prophethood and the book to remain in his seed and We gave him his reward in this world and in the hereafter he will most surely be among the good
And We sent Lut when he said to his people Most surely you are guilty of an indecency which none of the nations has ever done before you
What do you come to the males and commit robbery on the highway and you commit evil deeds in your assemblies
But nothing was the answer of his people except that they said Bring on us Allah s punishment if you are one of the truthful
He said My Lord help me against the mischievous people
And when Our apostles came to Ibrahim with the good news they said Surely we are going to destroy the people of this town for its people are unjust
He said Surely in it is Lut They said We know well who is in it we shall certainly deliver him and his followers except his wife she shall be of those who remain behind
And when Our apostles came to Lut he was grieved on account of them and he felt powerless to protect them and they said Fear not nor grieve surely we will deliver you and your followers except your wife she shall be of those who remain behind
Surely We will cause to come down upon the people of this town a punishment from heaven because they transgressed
And certainly We have left a clear sign of it for a people who understand
And to Madyan We sent their brother Shuaib so he said O my people serve Allah and fear the latter day and do not act corruptly in the land making mischief
But they rejected him so a severe earthquake overtook them and they became motionless bodies in their abode
And We destroyed Ad and Samood and from their dwellings this is apparent to you indeed and the Shaitan made their deeds fairseeming to them so he kept them back from the path though they were endowed with intelligence and skill
And We destroyed Qaroun and Firon and Haman and certainly Musa came to them with clear arguments but they behaved haughtily in the land yet they could not outstrip Us
So each We punished for his sin of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth and of them was he whom We drowned and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them but they were unjust to their own souls
The parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house and most surely the frailest of the houses is the spider s house did they but know
Surely Allah knows whatever thing they call upon besides Him and He is the Mighty the Wise
And as for these examples We set them forth for men and none understand them but the learned
Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth most surely there is a sign in this for the believers
Recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book and keep up prayer surely prayer keeps one away from indecency and evil and certainly the remembrance of Allah is the greatest and Allah knows what you do
And do not dispute with the followers of the Book except by what is best except those of them who act unjustly and say We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you and our Allah and your Allah is One and to Him do we submit
And thus have We revealed the Book to you
So those whom We have given the Book believe in it and of these there are those who believe in it and none deny Our communications except the unbelievers
And you did not recite before it any book nor did you transcribe one with your right hand for then could those who say untrue things have doubted
Nay these are clear communications in the breasts of those who are granted knowledge and none deny Our communications except the unjust
And they say Why are not signs sent down upon him from his Lord
Say The signs are only with Allah and I am only a plain warner
Is it not enough for them that We have revealed to you the Book which is recited to them
Most surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe
Say Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you He knows what is in the heavens and the earth
And as for those who believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in Allah these it is that are the losers
And they ask you to hasten on the chastisement and had not a term been appointed the chastisement would certainly have come to them and most certainly it will come to them all of a sudden while they will not perceive
They ask you to hasten on the chastisement and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers
On the day when the chastisement shall cover them from above them and from beneath their feet and He shall say Taste what you did
O My servants who believe surely My earth is vast therefore Me alone should you serve
Every soul must taste of death then to Us you shall be brought back
And as for those who believe and do good We will certainly give them abode in the high places in gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein how good the reward of the workers
Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely
And how many a living creature that does not carry its sustenance Allah sustains it and yourselves and He is the Hearing the Knowing
And if you ask them Who created the heavens and the earth and made the sun and the moon subservient they will certainly say Allah
Whence are they then turned away
Allah makes abundant the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants and straitens them for whom He pleases surely Allah is Cognizant of all things
And if you ask them Who is it that sends down water from the clouds then gives life to the earth with it after its death they will certainly say Allah
Say All praise is due to Allah
Nay most of them do not understand
And this life of the world is nothing but a sport and a play and as for the next abode that most surely is the life did they but know
So when they ride in the ships they call upon Allah being sincerely obedient to Him but when He brings them safe to the land lo they associate others with Him
Thus they become ungrateful for what We have given them so that they may enjoy but they shall soon know
Do they not see that We have made a sacred territory secure while men are carried off by force from around them
Will they still believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in the favour of Allah
And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie against Allah or gives the lie to the truth when it has come to him
Will not in hell be the abode of the unbelievers
And as for those who strive hard for Us We will most certainly guide them in Our ways and Allah is most surely with the doers of good
Alif Lam Mim
The Romans are vanquished
In a near land and they after being vanquished shall overcome
Within a few years
Allah s is the command before and after and on that day the believers shall rejoice
With the help of Allah He helps whom He pleases and He is the Mighty the Merciful
This is Allah s promise
Allah will not fail His promise but most people do not know
They know the outward of this world s life but of the hereafter they are absolutely heedless
Do they not reflect within themselves Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two but with truth and for an appointed term
And most surely most of the people are deniers of the meeting of their Lord
Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those before them They were stronger than these in prowess and dug up the earth and built on it in greater abundance than these have built on it and there came to them their apostles with clear arguments so it was not beseeming for Allah that He should deal with them unjustly but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
Then evil was the end of those who did evil because they
Allah originates the creation then reproduces it then to Him you shall be brought back
And at the time when the hour shall come the guilty shall be in despair
And they shall not have any intercessors from among their gods they have joined with Allah and they shall be deniers of their associategods
And at the time when the hour shall come at that time they shall become separated one from the other
Then as to those who believed and did good they shall be made happy in a garden
And as to those who disbelieved and rejected Our communications and the meeting of the hereafter these shall be brought over to the chastisement
Therefore glory be to Allah when you enter upon the time of the evening and when you enter upon the time of the morning
And to Him belongs praise in the heavens and the earth and at nightfall and when you are at midday
He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and gives life to the earth after its death and thus shall you be brought forth
And one of His signs is that He created you from dust then lo you are mortals who scatter
And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them and He put between you love and compassion most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect
And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your tongues and colors most surely there are signs in this for the learned
And one of His signs is your sleeping and your seeking of His grace by night and by day most surely there are signs in this for a people who would hear
And one of His signs is that He shows you the lightning for fear and for hope and sends down water from the clouds then gives life therewith to the earth after its death most surely there are signs in this for a people who understand
And one of His signs is that the heaven and the earth subsist by His command then when He calls you with a single call from out of the earth lo you come forth
And His is whosoever is in the heavens and the earth all are obedient to Him
And He it is Who originates the creation then reproduces it and it is easy to Him and His are the most exalted attributes in the heavens and the earth and He is the Mighty the Wise
He sets forth to you a parable relating to yourselves Have you among those whom your right hands possess partners in what We have given you for sustenance so that with respect to it you are alike you fear them as you fear each other Thus do We make the communications distinct for a people who understand
Nay those who are unjust follow their low desires without any knowledge so who can guide him whom Allah makes err
And they shall have no helpers
Then set your face upright for religion in the right state the nature made by Allah in which He has made men there is no altering of Allah s creation that is the right religion but most people do not know
Turning to Him and be careful of your duty to Him and keep up prayer and be not of the polytheists
Of those who divided their religion and became seas every sect rejoicing in what they had with them
And when harm afflicts men they call upon their Lord turning to Him then when He makes them taste of mercy from Him lo some of them begin to associate others with their Lord
So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them but enjoy yourselves for a while for you shall soon come to know
Or have We sent down upon them an authority so that it speaks of that which they associate with Him
And when We make people taste of mercy they rejoice in it and if an evil befall them for what their hands have already wrought lo they are in despair
Do they not see that Allah makes ample provision for whom He pleases or straitens
Most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
Then give to the near of kin his due and to the needy and the wayfarer this is best for those who desire Allah s pleasure and these it is who are successful
And whatever you lay out as usury so that it may increase in the property of men it shall not increase with Allah and whatever you give in charity desiring Allah s pleasure it is these persons that shall get manifold
Allah is He Who created you then gave you sustenance then He causes you to die then brings you to life
Is there any of your associategods who does aught of it
Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate with Him
Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men have wrought that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done so that they may return
Say Travel in the land then see how was the end of those before most of them were polytheists
Then turn thy face straight to the right religion before there come from Allah the day which cannot be averted on that day they shall become separated
Whoever disbelieves he shall be responsible for his disbelief and whoever does good they prepare good for their own souls
That He may reward those who believe and do good out of His grace surely He does not love the unbelievers
And one of His signs is that He sends forth the winds bearing good news and that He may make your taste of His mercy and that the ships may run by His command and that you may seek of His grace and that you may be grateful
And certainly We sent before you apostles to their people so they came to them with clear arguments then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty and helping the believers is ever incumbent on Us
Allah is he Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from inside it then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants lo they are joyful
Though they were before this before it was sent down upon them confounded in sure despair
Look then at the signs of Allah s mercy how He gives life to the earth after its death most surely He will raise the dead to life and He has power over all things
And if We send a wind and they see it to be yellow they would after that certainly continue to disbelieve
For surely you cannot make the dead to hear and you cannot make the deaf to hear the call when they turn back and
Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error
You cannot make to hear any but those who believe in Our communications so they shall submit
Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness then ordained weakness and hoary hair after strength He creates what He pleases and He is the Knowing the Powerful
And at the time when the hour shall come the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour thus are they ever turned away
And those who are given knowledge and faith will say Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the day of resurrection so this is the day of resurrection but you did not know
But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust nor shall they be regarded with goodwill
And certainly We have set forth for men every kind of example in this Quran and if you should bring them a communication those who disbelieve would certainly say You are naught but false claimants
Thus does Allah set a seal on the hearts of those who do not know
Therefore be patient surely the promise of Allah is true and let not those who have no certainty hold you in light estimation
Alif Lam Mim
These are verses of the Book of Wisdom
A guidance and a mercy for the doers of goodness
Those who keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and they are certain of the hereafter
These are on a guidance from their Lord and these are they who are successful
And of men is he who takes instead frivolous discourse to lead astray from Allah s path without knowledge and to take it for a mockery these shall have an abasing chastisement
And when Our communications are recited to him he turns back proudly as if he had not heard them as though in his ears were a heaviness therefore announce to him a painful chastisement
As for those who believe and do good they shall surely have gardens of bliss
Abiding in them the promise of Allah a true promise and He is the Mighty the Wise
He created the heavens without pillars as you see them and put mountains upon the earth lest it might convulse with you and He spread in it animals of every kind and We sent down water from the cloud then caused to grow therein vegetation of every noble kind
This is Allah s creation but show Me what those besides Him have created
Nay the unjust are in manifest error
And certainly We gave wisdom to Luqman saying Be grateful to Allah
And whoever is grateful he is only grateful for his own soul and whoever is ungrateful then surely Allah is Selfsufficient Praised
And when Luqman said to his son while he admonished him O my son do not associate aught with Allah most surely polytheism is a grievous iniquity
And We have enjoined man in respect of his parents his mother bears him with faintings upon faintings and his weaning takes two years saying Be grateful to Me and to both your parents to Me is the eventual coming
And if they contend with you that you should associate with Me what you have no knowledge of do not obey them and keep company with them in this world kindly and follow the way of him who turns to Me then to Me is your return then will I inform you of what you did
O my son surely if it is the very weight of the grain of a mustardseed even though it is in the heart of rock or high above in the heaven or deep down in the earth Allah will bring it to light surely Allah is Knower of subtleties Aware
O my son keep up prayer and enjoin the good and forbid the evil and bear patiently that which befalls you surely these acts require courage
And do not turn your face away from people in contempt nor go about in the land exulting overmuch surely Allah does not love any selfconceited boaster
And pursue the right course in your going about and lower your voice surely the most hateful of voices is braying of the asses
Do you not see that Allah has made what is in the heavens and what is in the earth subservient to you and made complete to you His favors outwardly and inwardly
And among men is he who disputes in respect of Allah though having no knowledge nor guidance nor a book giving light
And when it is said to them Follow what Allah has revealed they say Nay we follow that on which we found our fathers
What though the Shaitan calls them to the chastisement of the burning fire
And whoever submits himself wholly to Allah and he is the doer of good to others he indeed has taken hold of the firmest thing upon which one can lay hold and Allah s is the end of affairs
And whoever disbelieves let not his disbelief grieve you to Us is their return then will We inform them of what they did surely Allah is the Knower of what is in the breasts
We give them to enjoy a little then will We drive them to a severe chastisement
And if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will certainly say Allah
Say All praise is due to Allah nay most of them do not know
What is in the heavens and the earth is Allah s surely Allah is the Selfsufficient the Praised
And were every tree that is in the earth made into pens and the sea to supply it with ink with seven more seas to increase it the words of Allah would not come to an end surely Allah is Mighty Wise
Neither your creation nor your raising is anything but as a single soul surely Allah is Hearing Seeing
Do you not see that Allah makes the night to enter into the day and He makes the day to enter into the night and He has made the sun and the moon subservient to you each pursues its course till an appointed time and that Allah is Aware of what you do
This is because Allah is the Truth and that which they call upon besides Him is the falsehood and that Allah is the High the Great
Do you not see that the ships run on in the sea by Allah s favor that He may show you of His signs
Most surely there are signs in this for every patient endurer grateful one
And when a wave like mountains covers them they call upon Allah being sincere to Him in obedience but when He brings them safe to the land some of them follow the middle course and none denies Our signs but every perfidious ungrateful one
O people guard against the punishment of your Lord and dread the day when a father shall not make any satisfaction for his son nor shall the child be the maker of any satisfaction for his father surely the promise of Allah is true therefore let not this world s life deceive you nor let the archdeceiver deceive you in respect of Allah
Surely Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the hour and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the wombs and no one knows what he shall earn on the morrow and no one knows in what land he shall die surely Allah is Knowing Aware
Alif Lam Mim
The revelation of the Book there is no doubt in it is from the Lord of the worlds
Or do they say He has forged it
Nay it is the truth from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you that they may follow the right direction
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and He mounted the throne of authority you have not besides Him any guardian or any intercessor will you not then mind
He regulates the affair from the heaven to the earth then shall it ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count
This is the Knower of the unseen and the seen the Mighty the Merciful
Who made good everything that He has created and He began the creation of man from dust
Then He made his progeny of an extract of water held in light estimation
Then He made him complete and breathed into him of His spirit and made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts little is it that you give thanks
And they say What when we have become lost in the earth shall we then certainly be in a new creation
Nay they are disbelievers in the meeting of their Lord
Say The angel of death who is given charge of you shall cause you to die then to your Lord you shall be brought back
And could you but see when the guilty shall hang down their heads before their Lord Our Lord we have seen and we have heard therefore send us back we will do good surely now we are certain
And if We had pleased We would certainly have given to every soul its guidance but the word which had gone forth from Me was just I will certainly fill hell with the jinn and men together
So taste because you neglected the meeting of this day of yours surely We forsake you and taste the abiding chastisement for what you did
Only they believe in Our communications who when they are reminded of them fall down in prostration and celebrate the praise of their Lord and they are not proud
Their sides draw away from their beds they call upon their Lord in fear and in hope and they spend benevolently out of what We have given them
So no soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh the eyes a reward for what they did
Is he then who is a believer like him who is a transgressor
They are not equal
As for those who believe and do good the gardens are their abidingplace an entertainment for what they did
And as for those who transgress their abode is the fire whenever they desire to go forth from it they shall be brought back into it and it will be said to them Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie
And most certainly We will make them taste of the nearer chastisement before the greater chastisement that haply they may turn
And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the communications of his Lord then he turns away from them
Surely We will give punishment to the guilty
And certainly We gave the Book to Musa so be not in doubt concerning the receiving of it and We made it a guide for the children of Israel
And We made of them Imams to guide by Our command when they were patient and they were certain of Our communications
Surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differ
Does it not point out to them the right way how many of the generations in whose abodes they go about did We destroy before them
Most surely there are signs in this will they not then hear
Do they not see that We drive the water to a land having no herbage then We bring forth thereby seedproduce of which their cattle and they themselves eat will they not then see
And they say When will this judgment take place If you are truthful
Say On the day of judgment the faith of those who now disbelieve will not profit them nor will they be respited
Therefore turn away from them and wait surely they too are waiting
O Prophet be careful of your duty to Allah and do not comply with the wishes of the unbelievers and the hypocrites surely Allah is Knowing Wise
And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord surely Allah is Aware of what you do
And rely on Allah and Allah is sufficient for a Protector
Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him nor has He made your wives whose backs you liken to the backs of your mothers as your mothers nor has He made those whom you assert to be your sons your real sons these are the words of your mouths and Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the way
Assert their relationship to their fathers this is more equitable with Allah but if you do not know their fathers then they are your brethren in faith and your friends and there is no blame on you concerning that in which you made a mistake but concerning that which your hearts do purposely blame may rest on you and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they have on themselves and his wives are as their mothers and the possessors of relationship have the better claim in the ordinance of Allah to inheritance one with respect to another than other believers and than those who have fled their homes except that you do some good to your friends this is written in the Book
And when We made a covenant with the prophets and with you and with Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and Isa son of Marium and We made with them a strong covenant
That He may question the truthful of their truth and He has prepared for the unbelievers a painful punishment
O you who believe call to mind the favor of Allah to you when there came down upon you hosts so We sent against them a strong wind and hosts that you saw not and Allah is Seeing what you do
When they came upon you from above you and from below you and when the eyes turned dull and the hearts rose up to the throats and you began to think diverse thoughts of Allah
There the believers were tried and they were shaken with severe shaking
And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease began to say Allah and His Apostle did not promise us victory but only to deceive
And when a party of them said O people of Yasrib there is no place to stand for you here therefore go back and a party of them asked permission of the prophet saying Surely our houses are exposed and they were not exposed they only desired to fly away
And if an entry were made upon them from the outlying parts of it then they were asked to wage war they would certainly have done it and they would not have stayed in it but a little while
And certainly they had made a covenant with Allah before that they would not turn their backs and Allah s covenant shall be inquired of
Say Flight shall not do you any good if you fly from death or slaughter and in that case you will not be allowed to enjoy yourselves but a little
Say Who is it that can withhold you from Allah if He intends to do you evil rather He intends to show you mercy
And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any guardian or a helper
Allah knows indeed those among you who hinder others and those who say to their brethren Come to us and they come not to the fight but a little
Being niggardly with respect to you but when fear comes you will see them looking to you their eyes rolling like one swooning because of death but when the fear is gone they smite you with sharp tongues being niggardly of the good things These have not believed therefore Allah has made their doing naught and this is easy to Allah
They think the allies are not gone and if the allies should come again they would fain be in the deserts with the desert Arabs asking for news about you and if they were among you they would not fight save a little
Certainly you have in the Apostle of Allah an excellent exemplar for him who hopes in Allah and the latter day and remembers Allah much
And when the believers saw the allies they said This is what Allah and His Apostle promised us and Allah and His Apostle spoke the truth and it only increased them in faith and submission
Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah so of them is he who accomplished his vow and of them is he who yet waits and they have not changed in the least
That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He please or turn to them mercifully surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And Allah turned back the unbelievers in their rage they did not obtain any advantage and Allah sufficed the believers in fighting and Allah is Strong Mighty
And He drove down those of the followers of the Book who backed them from their fortresses and He cast awe into their hearts some you killed and you took captive another part
And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property and to a land which you have not yet trodden and Allah has power over all things
O Prophet say to your wives If you desire this world s life and its adornment then come I will give you a provision and allow you to depart a goodly departing
And if you desire Allah and His Apostle and the latter abode then surely Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a mighty reward
O wives of the prophet whoever of you commits an open indecency the punishment shall be increased to her doubly and this is easy to Allah
And whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Apostle and does good We will give to her reward doubly and We have prepared for her an honorable sustenance
O wives of the Prophet you are not like any other of the women If you will be on your guard then be not soft in your speech lest he in whose heart is a disease yearn and speak a good word
And stay in your houses and do not display your finery like the displaying of the ignorance of yore and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and obey Allah and His Apostle Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you O people of the House and to purify you a thorough purifying
And keep to mind what is recited in your houses of the communications of Allah and the wisdom surely Allah is Knower of subtleties Aware
Surely the men who submit and the women who submit and the believing men and the believing women and the obeying men and the obeying women and the truthful men and the truthful women and the patient men and the patient women and the humble men and the humble women and the almsgiving men and the almsgiving women and the fasting men and the fasting women and the men who guard their private parts and the women who guard and the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a mighty reward
And it behoves not a believing man and a believing woman that they should have any choice in their matter when Allah and His Apostle have decided a matter and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle he surely strays off a manifest straying
And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favor and to whom you had shown a favor Keep your wife to yourself and be careful of your duty to Allah and you concealed in your soul what Allah would bring to light and you feared men and Allah had a greater right that you should fear Him But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her We gave her to you as a wife so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have accomplished their want of them and Allah s command shall be performed
There is no harm in the Prophet doing that which Allah has ordained for him such has been the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before and the command of Allah is a decree that is made absolute
Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear any one but Allah and Allah is sufficient to take account
Muhammad is not the father of any of your men but he is the Apostle of Allah and the Last of the prophets and Allah is cognizant of all things
O you who believe remember Allah remembering frequently
And glorify Him morning and evening
He it is Who sends His blessings on you and so do His angels that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness into the light and He is Merciful to the believers
Their salutation on the day that they meet Him shall be Peace and He has prepared for them an honourable reward
O Prophet surely We have sent you as a witness and as a bearer of good news and as a warner
And as one inviting to Allah by His permission and as a lightgiving torch
And give to the believers the good news that they shall have a great grace from Allah
And be not compliant to the unbelievers and the hypocrites and leave unregarded their annoying talk and rely on Allah and Allah is sufficient as a Protector
O you who believe when you marry the believing women then divorce them before you touch them you have in their case no term which you should reckon so make some provision for them and send them forth a goodly sending forth
O Prophet surely We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given to you as prisoners of war and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who fled with you and a believing woman if she gave herself to the Prophet if the Prophet desired to marry her specially for you not for the rest of believers We know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess in order that no blame may attach to you and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
You may put off whom you please of them and you may take to you whom you please and whom you desire of those whom you had separated provisionally no blame attaches to you this is most proper so that their eyes may be cool and they may not grieve and that they should be pleased all of them with what you give them and Allah knows what is in your hearts and Allah is Knowing Forbearing
It is not allowed to you to take women afterwards nor that you should change them for other wives though their beauty be pleasing to you except what your right hand possesses and Allah is Watchful over all things
O you who believe do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal not waiting for its cooking being finished but when you are invited enter and when you have taken the food then disperse not seeking to listen to talk surely this gives the Prophet trouble but he forbears from you and Allah does not forbear from the truth And when you ask of them any goods ask of them from behind a curtain this is purer for your hearts and for their hearts and it does not behove you that you should give trouble to the Apostle of Allah nor that you should marry his wives after him ever surely this is grievous in the sight of Allah
If you do a thing openly or do it in secret then surely Allah is Cognizant of all things
There is no blame on them in respect of their fathers nor their brothers nor their brothers sons nor their sisters sons nor their own women nor of what their right hands possess and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is a witness of all things
Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet O you who believe call for Divine blessings on him and salute him with a becoming salutation
Surely as for those who speak evil things of Allah and His Apostle Allah has cursed them in this world and the here after and He has prepared for them a chastisement bringing disgrace
And those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing women without their having earned it they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin
O Prophet say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their overgarments this will be more proper that they may be known and thus they will not be given trouble and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the agitators in the city do not desist We shall most certainly set you over them then they shall not be your neighbors in it but for a little while
Cursed wherever they are found they shall be seized and murdered a horrible murdering
Such has been the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah
Men ask you about the hour say The knowledge of it is only with Allah and what will make you comprehend that the hour may be nigh
Surely Allah has cursed the unbelievers and has prepared for them a burning fire
To abide therein for a long time they shall not find a protector or a helper
On the day when their faces shall be turned back into the fire they shall say O would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Apostle
And they shall say O our Lord surely we obeyed our leaders and our great men so they led us astray from the path
O our Lord give them a double punishment and curse them with a great curse
O you who believe be not like those who spoke evil things of Musa but Allah cleared him of what they said and he was worthy of regard with Allah
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah and speak the right word
He will put your deeds into a right state for you and forgive you your faults and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle he indeed achieves a mighty success
Surely We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to be unfaithful to it and feared from it and man has turned unfaithful to it surely he is unjust ignorant
So Allah will chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women and Allah will turn mercifully to the believing women and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
All praise is due to Allah Whose is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and to Him is due all praise in the hereafter and He is the Wise the Aware
He knows that which goes down into the earth and that which comes out of it and that which comes down from the heaven and that which goes up to it and He is the Merciful the Forgiving
And those who disbelieve say The hour shall not come upon us Say Yea by my Lord the Knower of the unseen it shall certainly come upon you not the weight of an atom becomes absent from Him in the heavens or in the earth and neither less than that nor greater but all is in a clear book
That He may reward those who believe and do good these it is for whom is forgiveness and an honorable sustenance
And as for those who strive hard in opposing Our communications these it is for whom is a painful chastisement of an evil kind
And those to whom the knowledge has been given see that which has been revealed to you from your Lord that is the truth and it guides into the path of the Mighty the Praised
And those who disbelieve say Shall we point out to you a man who informs you that when you are scattered the utmost scattering you shall then be most surely raised in to a new creation
He has forged a lie against Allah or there is madness in him
Nay those who do not believe in the hereafter are in torment and in great error
Do they not then consider what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth
If We please We will make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them a portion from the heaven most surely there is a sign in this for every servant turning to Allah
And certainly We gave to Dawood excellence from Us O mountains sing praises with him and the birds and We made the iron pliant to him
Saying Make ample coats of mail and assign a time to the making of coats of mail and do good surely I am Seeing what you do
And We made the wind subservient to Sulaiman which made a month s journey in the morning and a month s journey in the evening and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow out for him and of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the command of his Lord and whoever turned aside from Our command from among them We made him taste of the punishment of burning
They made for him what he pleased of fortresses and images and bowls large as wateringtroughs and cookingpots that will not move from their place give thanks O family of Dawood and very few of My servants are grateful
But when We decreed death for him naught showed them his death but a creature of the earth that ate away his staff and when it fell down the jinn came to know plainly that if they had known the unseen they would not have tarried in abasing torment
Certainly there was a sign for Saba in their abode two gardens on the right and the left eat of the sustenance of your Lord and give thanks to Him a good land and a Forgiving Lord
But they turned aside so We sent upon them a torrent of which the rush could not be withstood and in place of their two gardens We gave to them two gardens yielding bitter fruit and growing tamarisk and a few lotetrees
This We requited them with because they disbelieved and We do not punish any but the ungrateful
And We made between them and the towns which We had blessed other towns to be easily seen and We apportioned the journey therein Travel through them nights and days secure
And they said O our Lord make spaces to be longer between our journeys and they were unjust to themselves so We made them stories and scattered them with an utter scattering most surely there are signs in this for every patient grateful one
And certainly the Shaitan found true his conjecture concerning them so they follow him except a party of the believers
And he has no authority over them but that We may distinguish him who believes in the hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it and your Lord is the Preserver of all things
Say Call upon those whom you assert besides Allah they do not control the weight of an atom in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any partnership in either nor has He among them any one to back Him up
And intercession will not avail aught with Him save of him whom He permits
Until when fear shall be removed from their hearts They shall say What is it that your Lord said
They shall say The truth
And He is the Most High the Great
Say Who gives you the sustenance from the heavens and the earth
Say Allah
And most surely we or you are on a right way or in manifest error
Say You will not be questioned as to what we are guilty of nor shall we be questioned as to what you do
Say Our Lord will gather us together then will He judge between us with the truth and He is the greatest Judge the Allknowing
Say Show me those whom you have joined with Him as associates by no means can you do it Nay
He is Allah the Mighty the Wise
And We have not sent you but to all the men as a bearer of good news and as a warner but most men do not know
And they say When will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful
Say You have the appointment of a day from which you cannot hold back any while nor can you bring it on
And those who disbelieve say By no means will we believe in this Quran nor in that which is before it and could you see when the unjust shall be made to stand before their Lord bandying words one with another
Those who were reckoned weak shall say to those who were proud Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers
Those who were proud shall say to those who were deemed weak Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you
Nay you yourselves were guilty
And those who were deemed weak shall say to those who were proud
Nay it was planning by night and day when you told us to disbelieve in Allah and to set up likes with Him
And they shall conceal regret when they shall see the punishment and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved they shall not be requited but what they did
And We never sent a warner to a town but those who led lives in ease in it said We are surely disbelievers in what you are sent with
And they say We have more wealth and children and we shall not be punished
Say Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases and straitens for whom He pleases but most men do not know
And not your wealth nor your children are the things which bring you near Us in station but whoever believes and does good these it is for whom is a double reward for what they do and they shall be secure in the highest places
And as for those who strive in opposing Our communications they shall be caused to be brought to the chastisement
Say Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His servants and straitens them for whom He pleases and whatever thing you spend He exceeds it in reward and He is the best of Sustainers
And on the day when He will gather them all together then will He say to the angels Did these worship you
They shall say Glory be to Thee
Thou art our Guardian not they nay they worshipped the jinn most of them were believers in them
So on that day one of you shall not control profit or harm for another and We will say to those who were unjust Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie
And when Our clear communications are recited to them they say This is naught but a man who desires to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped And they say This is naught but a lie that is forged
And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them This is only clear enchantment
And We have not given them any books which they read nor did We send to them before you a warner
And those before them rejected the truth and these have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them but they gave the lie to My apostles then how was the manifestation of My disapproval
Say I exhort you only to one thing that rise up for Allah s sake in twos and singly then ponder there is no madness in your fellowcitizen he is only a warner to you before a severe chastisement
Say Whatever reward I have asked of you that is only for yourselves my reward is only with Allah and He is a witness of all things
Say Surely my Lord utters the truth the great Knower of the unseen
Say The truth has come and the falsehood shall vanish and shall not come back
Say If I err I err only against my own soul and if I follow a right direction it is because of what my Lord reveals to me surely He is Hearing Nigh
And could you see when they shall become terrified but then there shall be no escape and they shall be seized upon from a near place
And they shall say We believe in it
And how shall the attaining of faith be possible to them from a distant place
And they disbelieved in it before and they utter conjectures with regard to the unseen from a distant place
And a barrier shall be placed between them and that which they desire as was done with the likes of them before surely they are in a disquieting doubt
All praise is due to Allah the Originator of the heavens and the earth the Maker of the angels apostles flying on wings two and three and four He increases in creation what He pleases surely Allah has power over all things
Whatever Allah grants to men of His mercy there is none to withhold it and what He withholds there is none to send it forth after that and He is the Mighty the Wise
O men call to mind the favor of Allah on you is there any creator besides Allah who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth There is no god but He whence are you then turned away
And if they call you a liar truly apostles before you were called liars and to Allah are all affairs returned
O men surely the promise of Allah is true therefore let not the life of this world deceive you and let not the archdeceiver deceive you respecting Allah
Surely the Shaitan is your enemy so take him for an enemy he only invites his party that they may be inmates of the burning
As for those who disbelieve they shall have a severe punishment and as for those who believe and do good they shall have forgiveness and a great reward
What is he whose evil deed is made fairseeming to him so much so that he considers it good Now surely Allah makes err whom He pleases and guides aright whom He pleases so let not your soul waste away in grief for them surely Allah is Cognizant of what they do
And Allah is He Who sends the winds so they raise a cloud then We drive it on to a dead country and therewith We give life to the earth after its death even so is the quickening
Whoever desires honor then to Allah belongs the honor wholly To Him do ascend the good words and the good deeds lift them up and as for those who plan evil deeds they shall have a severe chastisement and as for their plan it shall perish
And Allah created you of dust then of the lifegerm then He made you pairs and no female bears nor does she bring forth except with His knowledge and no one whose life is lengthened has his life lengthened nor is aught diminished of one s life but it is all in a book surely this is easy to Allah
And the two seas are not alike the one sweet that subdues thirst by its excessive sweetness pleasant to drink and the other salt that burns by its saltness yet from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which you wear and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful
He causes the night to enter in upon the day and He causes the day to enter in upon the night and He has made subservient to you the sun and the moon each one follows its course to an appointed time this is Allah your Lord His is the kingdom and those whom you call upon besides Him do not control a straw
If you call on them they shall not hear your call and even if they could hear they shall not answer you and on the resurrection day they will deny your associating them with Allah and none can inform you like the One Who is Aware
O men you are they who stand in need of Allah and Allah is He Who is the Selfsufficient the Praised One
If He please He will take you off and bring a new generation
And this is not hard to Allah
And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry for another to carry its burden not aught of it shall be carried even though he be near of kin You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer and whoever purifies himself he purifies himself only for the good of his own soul and to Allah is the eventual coming
And the blind and the seeing are not alike
Nor the darkness and the light
Nor the shade and the heat
Neither are the living and the dead alike
Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves
You are naught but a warner
Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner and there is not a people but a warner has gone among them
And if they call you a liar so did those before them indeed call their apostles liars their apostles had come to them with clear arguments and with scriptures and with the illuminating book
Then did I punish those who disbelieved so how was the manifestation of My disapproval
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colors and in the mountains are streaks white and red of various hues and others intensely black
And of men and beasts and cattle are various species of it likewise those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah surely Allah is Mighty Forgiving
Surely they who recite the Book of Allah and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly hope for a gain which will not perish
That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace surely He is Forgiving Multiplier of rewards
And that which We have revealed to you of the Book that is the truth verifying that which is before it most surely with respect to His servants Allah is Aware Seeing
Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss and of them is he who takes a middle course and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah s permission this is the great excellence
Gardens of perpetuity they shall enter therein they shad be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls and their dress therein shall be silk
And they shall say All praise is due to Allah Who has made grief to depart from us most surely our Lord is Forgiving Multiplier of rewards
Who has made us alight in a house abiding for ever out of His grace toil shall not touch us therein nor shall fatigue therein afflict us
And as for those who disbelieve for them is the fire of hell it shall not be finished with them entirely so that they should die nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them even thus do We retribute every ungrateful one
And they shall cry therein for succour O our Lord take us out we will do good deeds other than those which we used to do Did We not preserve you alive long enough so that he who would be mindful in it should mind And there came to you the warner therefore taste because for the unjust there is no helper
Surely Allah is the Knower of what is unseen in the heavens and the earth surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts
He it is Who made you rulers in the land therefore whoever disbelieves his unbelief is against himself and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything except hatred and their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss
Say Have you considered your associates which you call upon besides Allah
Show me what part of the earth they have created or have they any share in the heavens or have We given them a book so that they follow a clear argument thereof
Nay the unjust do not hold out promises one to another but only to deceive
Surely Allah upholds the heavens and the earth lest they come to naught and if they should come to naught there Is none who can uphold them after Him surely He is the Forbearing the Forgiving
And they swore by Allah with the strongest of their oaths that if there came to them a warner they would be better guided than any of the nations but when there came to them a warner it increased them in naught but aversion
In behaving proudly in the land and in planning evil and the evil plans shall not beset any save the authors of it
Then should they wait for aught except the way of the former people
For you shall not find any alteration in the course of Allah and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah
Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the end of those before them while they were stronger than these in power
And Allah is not such that any thing in the heavens or in the earth should escape Him surely He is Knowing Powerful
And were Allah to punish men for what they earn He would not leave on the back of it any creature but He respites them till an appointed term so when their doom shall come then surely Allah is Seeing with respect to His servants
Ya Seen
I swear by the Quran full of wisdom
Most surely you are one of the apostles
On a right way
A revelation of the Mighty the Merciful
That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned so they are heedless
Certainly the word has proved true of most of them so they do not believe
Surely We have placed chains on their necks and these reach up to their chins so they have their heads raised aloft
And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them then We have covered them over so that they do not see
And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not they do not believe
You can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent Allah in secret so announce to him forgiveness and an honorable reward
Surely We give life to the dead and We write down what they have sent before and their footprints and We have recorded everything in a clear writing
And set out to them an example of the people of the town when the apostles came to it
When We sent to them two they rejected both of them then We strengthened them with a third so they said Surely we are apostles to you
They said You are naught but mortals like ourselves nor has the Beneficent Allah revealed anything you only lie
They said Our Lord knows that we are most surely apostles to you
And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance of the message
They said Surely we augur evil from you if you do not desist we will certainly stone you and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us
They said Your evil fortune is with you what if you are reminded
Nay you are an extravagant people
And from the remote part of the city there came a man running he said O my people follow the apostles
Follow him who does not ask you for reward and they are the followers of the right course
And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence
And to Him you shall be brought back
What shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession If the Beneficent Allah should desire to afflict me with a harm shall not avail me aught nor shall they be able to deliver me
In that case I shall most surely be in clear error
Surely I believe in your Lord therefore hear me
It was said Enter the garden
He said O would that my people had known
Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored ones
And We did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven nor do We ever send down
It was naught but a single cry and lo they were still
Alas for the servants there comes not to them an apostle but they mock at him
Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them because they do not turn to them
And all of them shall surely be brought before Us
And a sign to them is the dead earth We give life to it and bring forth from it grain SQ they eat of it
And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it
That they may eat of the fruit thereof and their hands did not make it will they not then be grateful
Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things of what the earth grows and of their kind and of what they do not know
And a sign to them is the night We draw forth from it the day then lo they are in the dark
And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it that is the ordinance of the Mighty the Knowing
And as for the moon We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm branch
Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon nor can the night outstrip the day and all float on in a sphere
And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship
And We have created for them the like of it what they will ride on
And if We please We can drown them then there shall be no succorer for them nor shall they be rescued
But by mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time
And when it is said to them Guard against what is before you and what is behind you that mercy may be had on you
And there comes not to them a communication of the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it
And when it is said to them Spend out of what Allah has given you those who disbelieve say to those who believe Shall we feed him whom if Allah please He could feed
You are in naught but clear error
And they say When will this threat come to pass if you are truthful
They wait not for aught but a single cry which will overtake them while they yet contend with one another
So they shall not be able to make a bequest nor shall they return to their families
And the trumpet shall be blown when lo from their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord
They shall say O woe to us who has raised us up from our sleepingplace
This is what the Beneficent Allah promised and the apostles told the truth
There would be naught but a single cry when lo they shall all be brought before Us
So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did
Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy
They and their wives shall be in shades reclining on raised couches
They shall have fruits therein and they shall have whatever they desire
Peace a word from a Merciful Lord
And get aside today O guilty ones
Did I not charge you O children of Adam that you should not serve the Shaitan Surely he is your open enemy
And that you should serve Me this is the right way
And certainly he led astray numerous people from among you
What could you not then understand
This is the hell with which you were threatened
Enter into it this day because you disbelieved
On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths and their hands shall speak to Us and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned
And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes then they would run about groping for the way but how should they see
And if We please We would surely transform them in their place then they would not be able to go on nor will they return
And whomsoever We cause to live long We reduce him to an abject state in constitution do they not then understand
And We have not taught him poetry nor is it meet for him it is nothing but a reminder and a plain Quran
That it may warn him who would have life and that the word may prove true against the unbelievers
Do they not see that We have created cattle for them out of what Our hands have wrought so they are their masters
And We have subjected them to them so some of them they have to ride upon and some of them they eat
And therein they have advantages and drinks will they not then be grateful
And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped
But they shall not be able to assist them and they shall be a host brought up before them
Therefore let not their speech grieve you surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly
Does not man see that We have created him from the small seed Then lo he is an open disputant
And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation Says he Who will give life to the bones when they are rotten
Say He will give life to them Who brought them into existence at first and He is cognizant of all creation
He Who has made for you the fire to burn from the green tree so that with it you kindle fire
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them
Yea and He is the Creator of all the Knower
His command when He intends anything is only to say to it Be so it is
Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things and to Him you shall be brought back
I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks
Then those who drive away with reproof
Then those who recite being mindful
Most surely your Allah is One
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them and Lord of the easts
Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment the stars
And there is a safeguard against every rebellious Shaitan
They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side
Being driven off and for them is a perpetual chastisement
Except him who snatches off but once then there follows him a brightly shining flame
Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those others whom We have created
Surely We created them of firm clay
Nay you wonder while they mock
And when they are reminded they mind not
And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff
And they say This is nothing but clear magic
What when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then certainly be raised
Or our fathers of yore
Say Aye and you shall be abject
So it shall only be a single cry when lo they shall see
And they shall say O woe to us this is the day of requital
This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie
Gather together those who were unjust and their associates and what they used to worship
Besides Allah then lead them to the way to hell
And stop them for they shall be questioned
What is the matter with you that you do not help each other
Nay on that day they shall be submissive
And some of them shall advance towards others questioning each other
They shall say Surely you used to come to us from the right side
They shall say Nay you yourselves were not believers
And we had no authority over you but you were an inordinate people
So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us now we shall surely taste
So we led you astray for we ourselves were erring
So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another
Surely thus do We deal with the guilty
Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to them There is no god but Allah
And to say What shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet
Nay he has come with the truth and verified the apostles
Most surely you will taste the painful punishment
And you shall not be rewarded except for what you did
Save the servants of Allah the purified ones
For them is a known sustenance
Fruits and they shall be highly honored
In gardens of pleasure
On thrones facing each other
A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of springs
White delicious to those who drink
There shall be no trouble in it nor shall they be exhausted therewith
And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes having beautiful eyes
As if they were eggs carefully protected
Then shall some of them advance to others questioning each other
A speaker from among them shall say Surely I had a comrade of mine
Who said What are you indeed of those who accept the truth
What when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then be certainly brought to judgment
He shall say Will you look on
Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell
He shall say By Allah you had almost caused me to perish
And had it not been for the favor of my Lord I would certainly have been among those brought up
Is it then that we are not going to die
Except our previous death
And we shall not be chastised
Most surely this is the mighty achievement
For the like of this then let the workers work
Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust
Surely it is a tree thatgrows in the bottom of the hell
Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents
Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill their bellies with it
Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a mixture prepared in boiling water
Then most surely their return shall be to hell
Surely they found their fathers going astray
So in their footsteps they are being hastened on
And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them
And certainly We sent among them warners
Then see how was the end of those warned
Except the servants of Allah the purified ones
And Nuh did certainly call upon Us and most excellent answerer of prayer are We
And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress
And We made his offspring the survivors
And We perpetuated to him praise among the later generations
Peace and salutation to Nuh among the nations
Thus do We surely reward the doers of good
Surely he was of Our believing servants
Then We drowned the others
And most surely Ibrahim followed his way
When he came to his Lord with a free heart
When he said to his father and his people What is it that you worship
A lie gods besides Allah do you desire
What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds
Then he looked at the stars looking up once
Then he said Surely I am sick of your worshipping these
So they went away from him turning back
Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said What do you not eat
What is the matter with you that you do not speak
Then he turned against them secretly smiting them with the right hand
So they people advanced towards him hastening
Said he What do you worship what you hew out
And Allah has created you and what you make
They said Build for him a furnace then cast him into the burning fire
And they desired a war against him but We brought them low
And he said Surely I fly to my lord He will guide me
My Lord grant me of the doers of good deeds
So We gave him the good news of a boy possessing forbearance
And when he attained to working with him he said O my son surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you consider then what you see He said O my father do what you are commanded if Allah please you will find me of the patient ones
So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon his forehead
And We called out to him saying O Ibrahim
You have indeed shown the truth of the vision surely thus do We reward the doers of good
Most surely this is a manifest trial
And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice
And We perpetuated praise to him among the later generations
Peace be on Ibrahim
Thus do We reward the doers of good
Surely he was one of Our believing servants
And We gave him the good news of Ishaq a prophet among the good ones
And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq and of their offspring are the doers of good and also those who are clearly unjust to their own souls
And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun
And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress
And We helped them so they were the vanquishers
And We gave them both the Book that made things clear
And We guided them both on the right way
And We perpetuated praise to them among the later generations
Peace be on Musa and Haroun
Even thus do We reward the doers of good
Surely they were both of Our believing servants
And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles
When he said to his people Do you not guard against evil
What do you call upon Ba l and forsake the best of the creators
Allah your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore
But they called him a liar therefore they shall most surely be brought up
But not the servants of Allah the purified ones
And We perpetuated to him praise among the later generations
Peace be on Ilyas
Even thus do We reward the doers of good
Surely he was one of Our believing servants
And Lut was most surely of the apostles
When We delivered him and his followers all
Except an old woman who was amongst those who tarried
Then We destroyed the others
And most surely you pass by them in the morning
And at night do you not then understand
And Yunus was most surely of the apostles
When he ran away to a ship completely laden
So he shared with them but was of those who are cast off
So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which he blamed himself
But had it not been that he was of those who glorify Us
He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised
Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth while he was sick
And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant
And We sent him to a hundred thousand rather they exceeded
And they believed so We gave them provision till a time
Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they have sons
Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses
Now surely it is of their own lie that they say
Allah has begotten and most surely they are liars
Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
What is the matter with you how is it that you judge
Will you not then mind
Or have you a clear authority
Then bring your book if you are truthful
And they assert a relationship between Him and the jinn and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely be brought up
Glory be to Allah for freedom from what they describe
But not so the servants of Allah the purified ones
So surely you and what you worship
Not against Him can you cause any to fall into trial
Save him who will go to hell
And there is none of us but has an assigned place
And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in ranks
And we are most surely they who declare the glory of Allah
And surely they used to say
Had we a reminder from those of yore
We would certainly have been the servants of Allah the purified ones
But now they disbelieve in it so they will come to know
And certainly Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants the apostles
Most surely they shall be the assisted ones
And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones
Therefore turn away from them till a time
And then see them so they too shall see
What would they then hasten on Our chastisement
But when it shall descend in their court evil shall then be the morning of the warned ones
And turn away from them till a time
And then see for they too shall see
Glory be to your Lord the Lord of Honor above what they describe
And peace be on the apostles
And all praise is due to Allah the Lord of the worlds
Suad I swear by the Quran full of admonition
Nay those who disbelieve are in selfexaltation and opposition
How many did We destroy before them of the generations then they cried while the time of escaping had passed away
And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say This is an enchanter a liar
What makes he the gods a single Allah
A strange thing is this to be sure
And the chief persons of them break forth saying Go and steadily adhere to your gods this is most surely a thing sought after
We never heard of this in the former faith this is nothing but a forgery
Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us
Nay they are in doubt as to My reminder
Nay they have not yet tasted My chastisement
Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord the Mighty the great Giver
Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them
Then let them ascend by any
A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight
The people of Nuh and Ad and Firon the lord of spikes rejected apostles before them
And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the thicket these were the parties
There was none of them but called the apostles liars so just was My retribution
Nor do these await aught but a single cry there being no delay in it
And they say O our Lord hasten on to us our portion before the day of reckoning
Bear patiently what they say and remember Our servant Dawood the possessor of power surely he was frequent in returning to Allah
Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory of Allah in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise
And the birds gathered together all joined in singing with him
And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment
And has there come to you the story of the litigants when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls
When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened at them they said Fear not two litigants of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other therefore decide between us with justice and do not act unjustly and guide us to the right way
Surely this is my brother he has ninetynine ewes and I have a single ewe but he said Make it over to me and he has prevailed against me in discourse
He said Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe to add to his own ewes and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another save those who believe and do good and very few are they and Dawood was sure that We had tried him so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time to Him
Therefore We rectified for him this and most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort
o Dawood surely We have made you a ruler in the land so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah as for those who go astray from the path of Allah they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day of reckoning
And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain that is the opinion of those who disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of the fire
Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischiefmakers in the earth
Or shall We make those who guard against evil like the wicked
It is a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses and that those endowed with understanding may be mindful
And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman most excellent the servant
Surely he was frequent in returning to Allah
When there were brought to him in the evening horses still when standing swift when running
Then he said Surely I preferred the good things to the remembrance of my Lord until the sun set and time for Asr prayer was over he said
Bring them back to me so he began to slash their legs and necks
And certainly We tried Sulaiman and We put on his throne a mere body so he turned to Allah
He said My Lord do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for being inherited by anyone after me
Then We made the wind subservient to him it made his command to run gently wherever he desired
And the shaitans every builder and diver
And others fettered in chains
This is Our free gift therefore give freely or withhold without reckoning
And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort
And remember Our servant Ayyub when he called upon his Lord The Shaitan has afflicted me with toil and torment
Urge with your foot here is a cool washingplace and a drink
And We gave him his family and the like of them with them as a mercy from Us and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding
And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with It and do not break your oath surely We found him patient most excellent the servant Surely he was frequent in returning to Allah
And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub men of power and insight
Surely We purified them by a pure quality the keeping in mind of the final abode
And most surely they were with Us of the elect the best
And remember Ismail and AlYasha and Zulkifl and they were all of the best
This is a reminder and most surely there is an excellent resort for those who guard against evil
The gardens of perpetuity the doors are opened for them
Reclining therein calling therein for many fruits and drink
And with them shall be those restraining their eyes equals in age
This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning
Most surely this is Our sustenance it shall never come to an end
This shall be so and most surely there is an evil resort for the inordinate ones
Hell they shall enter it so evil is the restingplace
This shall be so so let them taste it boiling and intensely cold drink
And other punishment of the same kind of various sorts
This is an army plunging in without consideration along with you no welcome for them surely they shall enter fire
They shall say Nay you no welcome to you you did proffer it to us so evil is the restingplace
They shall say Our Lord whoever prepared it first for us add Thou to him a double chastisement in the fire
And they shall say What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious
Was it that we only took them in scorn or have our eyes now turned aside from them
That most surely is the truth the contending one with another of the inmates of the fire
Say I am only a warner and there is no god but Allah the One the Subduer of all
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them the Mighty the most Forgiving
Say It is a message of importance
And you are turning aside from it
I had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they contended
Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner
When your Lord said to the angels Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust
So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My spirit then fall down making obeisance to him
And the angels did obeisance all of them
But not Iblis he was proud and he was one of the unbelievers
He said O Iblis what prevented you that you should do obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands
Are you proud or are you of the exalted ones
He said I am better than he Thou hast created me of fire and him Thou didst create of dust
He said Then get out of it for surely you are driven away
And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment
He said My Lord then respite me to the day that they are raised
He said Surely you are of the respited ones
Till the period of the time made known
He said Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live an evil life all
Except Thy servants from among them the purified ones
He said The truth then is and the truth do I speak
That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you all
Say I do not ask you for any reward for it nor am I of those who affect
It is nothing but a reminder to the nations
And most certainly you will come to know about it after a time
The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth therefore serve Allah being sincere to Him in obedience
Now surely sincere obedience is due to Allah alone and as for those who take guardians besides Him saying We do not serve them save that they may make us nearer to Allah surely Allah will judge between them in that in which they differ surely Allah does not guide him aright who is a liar ungrateful
If Allah desire to take a son to Himself He will surely choose those He pleases from what He has created Glory be to Him He is Allah the One the Subduer of all
He has created the heavens and the earth with the truth He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night and He has made the sun and the moon subservient each one runs on to an assigned term now surely He is the Mighty the great Forgiver
He has created you from a single being then made its mate of the same kind and He has made for you eight of the cattle in pairs He creates you in the wombs of your mothers a creation after a creation in triple darkness that is Allah your Lord His is the kingdom there is no god but He whence are you then turned away
If you are ungrateful then surely Allah is Selfsufficient above all need of you and He does not like ungratefulness in His servants and if you are grateful He likes it in you and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another then to your Lord is your return then will He inform you of what you did surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts
And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord turning to Him frequently then when He makes him possess a favor from Him he forgets that for which he called upon Him before and sets up rivals to Allah that he may cause men to stray off from His path Say Enjoy yourself in your ungratefulness a little surely you are of the inmates of the fire
What he who is obedient during hours of the night prostrating himself and standing takes care of the hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord
Say Are those who know and those who do not know alike
Only the men of understanding are mindful
Say O my servants who believe be careful of your duty to your Lord for those who do good in this world is good and Allah s earth is spacious only the patient will be paid back their reward in full without measure
Say I am commanded that I should serve Allah being sincere to Him in obedience
And I am commanded that I shall be the first of those who submit
Say I fear if I disobey my Lord the chastisement of a grievous day
Say Allah it is Whom I serve being sincere to Him in my obedience
Serve then what you like besides Him
Say The losers surely are those who shall have lost themselves and their families on the day of resurrection now surely that is the clear loss
They shall have coverings of fire above them and coverings beneath them with that Allah makes His servants to fear so be careful of your duty to Me O My servants
And as for those who keep off from the worship of the idols and turn to Allah they shall have good news therefore give good news to My servants
Those who listen to the word then follow the best of it those are they whom Allah has guided and those it is who are the men of understanding
What as for him then against whom the sentence of chastisement is due What can you save him who is in the fire
But as for those who are careful of their duty to their Lord they shall have high places above them higher places built for them beneath which flow rivers this is the promise of Allah Allah will not fail in His promise
Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud then makes it go along in the earth in springs then brings forth therewith herbage of various colors then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow then He makes it a thing crushed and broken into pieces Most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding
What is he whose heart Allah has opened for Islam so that he is in a light from his Lord like the hardhearted
Nay woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of Allah those are in clear error
Allah has revealed the best announcement a book conformable in its various parts repeating whereat do shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord then their skins and their hearts become pliant to the remembrance of Allah this is Allah s guidance He guides with it whom He pleases and as for him whom Allah makes err there is no guide for him
Is he then who has to guard himself with his own person against the evil chastisement on the resurrection day
And it will be said to the unjust Taste what you earned
Those before them rejected prophets therefore there came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived not
So Allah made them taste the disgrace in this world s life and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is greater did they but know
And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran similitudes of every sort that they may mind
An Arabic Quran without any crookedness that they may guard against evil
Allah sets forth an example There is a slave in whom are several partners differing with one another and there is another slave wholly owned by one man
Are the two alike in condition
All praise is due to Allah
Nay most of them do not know
Surely you shall die and they too shall surely die
Then surely on the day of resurrection you will contend one with another before your Lord
Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against Allah and he who gives the lie to the truth when it comes to him is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers
And he who brings the truth and he who accepts it as the truth these are they that guard against evil
They shall have with their Lord what they please that is the reward of the doers of good
So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they did and give them their reward for the best of what they do
Is not Allah sufficient for His servant
And they seek to frighten you with those besides Him and whomsoever Allah makes err there is no guide for him
And whom Allah guides there is none that can lead him astray is not Allah Mighty the Lord of retribution
And should you ask them Who created the heavens and the earth They would most certainly say Allah
Say Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah would they if Allah desire to afflict me with harm be the removers of His harm or would they if Allah desire to show me mercy be the withholders of His mercy
Say Allah is sufficient for me on Him do the reliant rely
Say O my people work in your place surely I am a worker so you will come to know
Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which will disgrace him and to whom will be due a lasting punishment
Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth for the sake of men so whoever follows the right way it is for his own soul and whoever errs he errs only to its detriment and you are not a custodian over them
Allah takes the souls at the time of their death and those that die not during their sleep then He withholds those on whom He has passed the decree of death and sends the others back till an appointed term most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect
Or have they taken intercessors besides Allah
Say what even though they did not ever have control over anything nor do they understand
Say Allah s is the intercession altogether His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth then to Him you shall be brought back
And when Allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink and when those besides Him are mentioned lo they are joyful
Say O Allah Originator of the heavens and the earth Knower of the unseen and the seen
Thou only judgest between Thy servants as to that wherein they differ
And had those who are unjust all that is in the earth and the like of it with it they would certainly offer it as ransom to be saved from the evil of the punishment on the day of resurrection and what they never thought of shall become plain to them from Allah
And the evil consequences of what they wrought shall become plain to them and the very thing they mocked at shall beset them
So when harm afflicts a man he calls upon Us then when We give him a favor from Us he says I have been given it only by means of knowledge
Nay it is a trial but most of them do not know
Those before them did say it indeed but what they earned availed them not
So there befell them the evil consequences of what they earned and as for those who are unjust from among these there shall befall them the evil consequences of what they earn and they shall not escape
Do they not know that Allah makes ample the means of subsistence to whom He pleases and He straitens most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe
Say O my servants who have acted extravagantly against their own souls do not despair of the mercy of Allah surely Allah forgives the faults altogether surely He is the Forgiving the Merciful
And return to your Lord time after time and submit to Him before there comes to you the punishment then you shall not be helped
And follow the best that has been revealed to you from your Lord before there comes to you the punishment all of a sudden while you do not even perceive
Lest a soul should say O woe to me for what I fell short of my duty to Allah and most surely I was of those who laughed to scorn
Or it should say Had Allah guided me I would certainly have been of those who guard against evil
Or it should say when it sees the punishment Were there only a returning for me I should be of the doers of good
Aye My communications came to you but you rejected them and you were proud and you were one of the unbelievers
And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who lied against Allah their faces shall be blackened
Is there not in hell an abode for the proud
And Allah shall deliver those who guard against evil with their achievement evil shall not touch them nor shall they grieve
Allah is the Creator of every thing and He has charge over every thing
His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth and as for those who disbelieve in the communications of Allah these it is that are the losers
Say What
Do you then bid me serve others than Allah O ignorant men
And certainly it has been revealed to you and to those before you Surely if you associate with Allah your work would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of the losers
Nay but serve Allah alone and be of the thankful
And they have not honored Allah with the honor that is due to Him and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand glory be to Him and may He be exalted above what they associate with Him
And the trumpet shall be blown so all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon except such as Allah please then it shall be blown again then lo they shall stand up awaiting
And the earth shall beam with the light of its Lord and the Book shall be laid down and the prophets and the witnesses shall be brought up and judgment shall be given between them with justice and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
And every soul shall be paid back fully what it has done and He knows best what they do
And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in companies until when they come to it its doors shall be opened and the keepers of it shall say to them Did not there come to you apostles from among you reciting to you the communications of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours
They shall say Yea But the sentence of punishment was due against the unbelievers
It shall be said Enter the gates of hell to abide therein so evil is the abode of the proud
And those who are careful of their duty to their Lord shall be conveyed to the garden in companies until when they come to it and its doors shall be opened and the keepers of it shall say to them Peace be on you you shall be happy therefore enter it to abide
And they shall say All praise is due to Allah Who has made good to us His promise and He has made us inherit the land we may abide in the garden where we please so goodly is the reward of the workers
And you shall see the angels going round about the throne glorifying the praise of their Lord and judgment shall be given between them with justice and it shall be said All praise is due to Allah the Lord of the worlds
Ha Mim
The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Mighty the Knowing
The Forgiver of the faults and the Acceptor of repentance Severe to punish Lord of bounty there is no god but He to Him is the eventual coming
None dispute concerning the communications of Allah but those who disbelieve therefore let not their going to and fro in the cities deceive you
The people of Nuh and the parties after them rejected prophets before them and every nation purposed against their apostle to destroy him and they disputed by means of the falsehood that they might thereby render null the truth therefore I destroyed them how was then My retribution
And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the fire
Those who bear the power and those around Him celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask protection for those who believe Our Lord
Thou embracest all things in mercy and knowledge therefore grant protection to those who turn to Thee and follow Thy way and save them from the punishment of the hell
Our Lord and make them enter the gardens of perpetuity which Thou hast promised to them and those who do good of their fathers and their wives and their offspring surely Thou are the Mighty the Wise
And keep them from evil deeds and whom Thou keepest from evil deeds this day indeed Thou hast mercy on him and that is the mighty achievement
Surely those who disbelieve shall be cried out to Certainly Allah s hatred of you when you were called upon to the faith and you rejected is much greater than your hatred of yourselves
They shall say Our Lord twice didst Thou make us subject to death and twice hast Thou given us life so we do confess our faults is there then a way to get out
That is because when Allah alone was called upon you disbelieved and when associates were given to Him you believed so judgment belongs to Allah the High the Great
He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you sustenance from heaven and none minds but he who turns to Him again and again
Therefore call upon Allah being sincere to Him in obedience though the unbelievers are averse
Possessor of the highest rank Lord of power He makes the inspiration to light by His command upon whom He pleases of His servants that he may warn men of the day of meeting
Of the day when they shall come forth nothing concerning them remains hidden to Allah
To whom belongs the kingdom this day
To Allah the One the Subduer of all
This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has earned no injustice shall be done this day surely Allah is quick in reckoning
And warn them of the day that draws near when hearts shall rise up to the throats grieving inwardly the unjust shall not have any compassionate friend nor any intercessor who should be obeyed
He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal
And Allah judges with the truth and those whom they call upon besides Him cannot judge aught surely Allah is the Hearing the Seeing
Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those who were before them
Mightier than these were they in strength and in fortifications in the land but Allah destroyed them for their sins and there was not for them any defender against Allah
That was because there came to them their apostles with clear arguments but they rejected them therefore Allah destroyed them surely He is Strong Severe in retribution
And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and clear authority
To Firon and Haman and Qaroun but they said A lying magician
So when he brought to them the truth from Us they said Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women alive and the struggle of the unbelievers will only come to a state of perdition
And Firon said Let me alone that I may slay Musa and let him call upon his Lord surely I fear that he will change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear in the land
And Musa said Surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every proud one who does not believe in the day of reckoning
And a believing man of Firon s people who hid his faith said What will you slay a man because he says My Lord is Allah and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord
And if he be a liar on him will be his lie and if he be truthful there will befall you some of that which he threatens you with surely Allah does not guide him who is extravagant a liar
O my people yours is the kingdom this day being masters in the land but who will help us against the punishment of Allah if it come to us Firon said I do not show you aught but that which I see myself and I do not make you follow any but the right way
And he who believed said O my people surely I fear for you the like of what befell the parties
The like of what befell the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood and those after them and Allah does not desire injustice for His servants
And O my people
I fear for you the day of calling out
The day on which you will turn back retreating there shall be no savior for you from Allah and whomsoever Allah causes to err there is no guide for him
And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear arguments but you ever remained in doubt as to what he brought until when he died you said Allah will never raise an apostle after him
Thus does Allah cause him to err who is extravagant a doubter
Those who dispute concerning the communications of Allah without any authority that He has given them greatly hated is it by Allah and bythose who believe
Thus does Allah set a seal over the heart of every proud haughty one
And Firon said O Haman build for me a tower that I may attain the means of access
The means of access to the heavens then reach the god of Musa and I surely think him to be a liar And thus the evil of his deed was made fairseeming to Firon and he was turned away from the way and the struggle of Firon was not to end in aught but destruction
And he who believed said O my people follow me I will guide you to the right course
O my people this life of the world is only a passing enjoyment and surely the hereafter is the abode to settle
Whoever does an evil he shall not be recompensed with aught but the like of it and whoever does good whether male or female and he is a believer these shall enter the garden in which they shall be given sustenance without measure
And O my people how is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge and I call you to the Mighty the most Forgiving
No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be called to in this world nor in the hereafter and that our turning back is to Allah and that the extravagant are the inmates of the fire
So you shall remember what I say to you and I entrust my affair to Allah Surely Allah sees the servants
So Allah protected him from the evil consequences of what they planned and the most evil punishment overtook Firon s people
The fire they shall be brought before it every morning and evening and on the day when the hour shall come to pass Make Firon s people enter the severest chastisement
And when they shall contend one with another in the fire then the weak shall say to those who were proud Surely we were your followers will you then avert from us a portion of the fire
Those who were proud shall say Surely we are all in it surely Allah has judged between the servants
And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of hell Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of the punishment
They shall say Did not your apostles come to you with clear arguments
They shall say Yea
They shall say Then call
And the call of the unbelievers is only in error
Most surely We help Our apostles and those who believe in this world s life and on the day when the witnesses shall stand
The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the unjust and for them is curse and for them is the evil abode
And certainly We gave Musa the guidance and We made the children of Israel inherit the Book
A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding
Therefore be patient surely the promise of Allah is true and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning
Surely as for those who dispute about the communications of Allah without any authority that has come to them there is naught in their breasts but a desire to become great which they shall never attain to Therefore seek refuge in Allah surely He is the Hearing the Seeing
Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the men but most people do not know
And the blind and the seeing are not alike nor those who believe and do good and the evildoer little is it that you are mindful
Most surely the hour is coming there is no doubt therein but most people do not believe
And your Lord says Call upon Me I will answer you surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon enter hell abased
Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see most surely Allah is Gracious to men but most men do not give thanks
That is Allah your Lord the Creator of everything there is no Allah but He whence are you then turned away
Thus were turned away those who denied the communications of Allah
Allah is He Who made the earth a restingplace for you and the heaven a canopy and He formed you then made goodly your forms and He provided you with goodly things that is Allah your Lord blessed then is Allah the Lord of the worlds
He is the Living there is no god but He therefore call on Him being sincere to Him in obedience all praise is due to Allah the Lord of the worlds
Say I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my Lord and I am commanded that I should submit to the Lord of the worlds
He it is Who created you from dust then from a small lifegerm then from a clot then He brings you forth as a child then that you may attain your maturity then that you may be old and of you there are some who are caused to die before and that you may reach an appointed term and that you may understand
He it is Who gives life and brings death so when He decrees an affair He only says to it Be and it is
Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the communications of Allah how are they turned away
Those who reject the Book and that with which We have sent Our Apostle but they shall soon come to know
When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks they shall be dragged
Into boiling water then in the fire shall they be burned
Then shall it be said to them Where is that which you used to set up
Besides Allah
They shall say They are gone away from us nay we used not to call upon anything before
Thus does Allah confound the unbelievers
That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and because you behaved insolently
Enter the gates of hell to abide therein evil then is the abode of the proud
So be patient surely the promise of Allah is true So should We make you see part of what We threaten them with or should We cause you to die to Us shall they be returned
And certainly We sent apostles before you there are some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not mentioned to you and it was not meet for an apostle that he should bring a sign except with Allah s permission but when the command of Allah came judgment was given with truth and those who treated it as a lie were lost
Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride on some of them and some of them you eat
And there are advantages for you in them and that you may attain thereon a want which is in your breasts and upon them and upon the ships you are borne
And He shows you His signs which then of Allah s signs will you deny
Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them
They were more in numbers than these and greater in strength and in fortifications in the land but what they earned did not avail them
Then when their apostles came to them with clear arguments they exulted in what they had with them of knowledge and there beset them that which they used to mock
But when they saw Our punishment they said We believe in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with Him
But their belief was not going to profit them when they had seen Our punishment this is Allah s law which has indeed obtained in the matter of His servants and there the unbelievers are lost
Ha Mim
A revelation from the Beneficent the Merciful Allah
A Book of which the verses are made plain an Arabic Quran for a people who know
A herald of good news and a warner but most of them turn aside so they hear not
And they say Our hearts are under coverings from that to which you call us and there is a heaviness in our ears and a veil hangs between us and you so work we too are working
Say I am only a mortal like you it is revealed to me that your Allah is one Allah therefore follow the right way to Him and ask His forgiveness and woe to the polytheists
To those who do not give poorrate and they are unbelievers in the hereafter
As for those who believe and do good they shall surely have a reward never to be cut off
Say What do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two periods and do you set up equals with Him
That is the Lord of the Worlds
And He made in it mountains above its surface and He blessed therein and made therein its foods in four periods alike for the seekers
Then He directed Himself to the heaven and it is a vapor so He said to it and to the earth Come both willingly or unwillingly
They both said We come willingly
So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods and revealed in every heaven its affair and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and made it to guard that is the decree of the Mighty the Knowing
But if they turn aside then say I have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of Ad and Samood
When their apostles came to them from before them and from behind them saying Serve nothing but Allah they said If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent down angels so we are surely unbelievers in that with which you are sent
Then as to Ad they were unjustly proud in the land and they said Who is mightier in strength than we
Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength and they denied Our communications
So We sent on them a furious wind in unlucky days that We may make them taste the chastisement of abasement in this world s life and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is much more abasing and they shall not be helped
And as to Samood We showed them the right way but they chose error above guidance so there overtook them the scourge of an abasing chastisement for what they earned
And We delivered those who believed and guarded against evil
And on the day that the enemies of Allah shall be brought together to the fire then they shall be formed into groups
Until when they come to it their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them as to what they did
And they shall say to their skins Why have you borne witness against us
They shall say Allah Who makes everything speak has made us speak and He created you at first and to Him you shall be brought back
And you did not veil yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did
And that was your evil thought which you entertained about your Lord that has tumbled you down into perdition so are you become of the lost ones
Then if they will endure still the fire is their abode and if they ask for goodwill then are they not of those who shall be granted goodwill
And We have appointed for them comrades so they have made fairseeming to them what is before them and what is behind them and the word proved true against them among the nations of the jinn and the men that have passed away before them that they shall surely be losers
And those who disbelieve say Do not listen to this Quran and make noise therein perhaps you may overcome
Therefore We will most certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment and We will most certainly reward them for the evil deeds they used to do
That is the reward of the enemies of Allah the fire for them therein shall be the house of long abiding a reward for their denying Our communications
And those who disbelieve will say Our Lord show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and the men that we may trample them under our feet so that they may be of the lowest
As for those who say Our Lord is Allah then continue in the right way the angels descend upon them saying Fear not nor be grieved and receive good news of the garden which you were promised
We are your guardians in this world s life and in the hereafter and you shall have therein what your souls desire and you shall have therein what you ask for
A provision from the Forgiving the Merciful
And who speaks better than he who calls to Allah while he himself does good and says I am surely of those who submit
And not alike are the good and the evil Repel evil with what is best when lo he between whom and you was enmity would be as if he were a warm friend
And none are made to receive it but those who are patient and none are made to receive it but those who have a mighty good fortune
And if an interference of the Shaitan should cause you mischief seek refuge in Allah surely He is the Hearing the Knowing
And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon and prostrate to Allah Who created them if Him it is that you serve
But if they are proud yet those with your Lord glorify Him during the night and the day and they are not tired
And among His signs is this that you see the earth still but when We send down on it the water it stirs and swells most surely He Who gives it life is the Giver of life to the dead surely He has power over all things
Surely they who deviate from the right way concerning Our communications are not hidden from Us
What is he then who is cast into the fire better or he who comes safe on the day of resurrection
Do what you like surely He sees what you do
Surely those who disbelieve in the reminder when it comes to them and most surely it is a Mighty Book
Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it a revelation from the Wise the Praised One
Naught is said to you but what was said indeed to the apostles before you surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness and the Lord of painful retribution
And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue they would certainly have said Why have not its communications been made clear What a foreign tongue and an Arabian Say It is to those who believe a guidance and a healing and as for those who do not believe there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them these shall be called to from a faroff place
And certainly We gave the Book to Musa but it has been differed about and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord judgment would certainly have been given between them and most surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it
Whoever does good it is for his own soul and whoever does evil it is against it and your Lord is not in the least unjust to the servants
To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour and there come not forth any of the fruits from their coverings nor does a female bear nor does she give birth but with His knowledge and on the day when He shall call out to them Where are those whom you called My associates
They shall say We declare to Thee none of us is a witness
And away from them shall go what they called upon before and they shall know for certain that there is no escape for them
Man is never tired of praying for good and if evil touch him then he is despairing hopeless
And if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress that has touched him he would most certainly say This is of me and I do not think the hour will come to pass and if I am sent back to my Lord I shall have with Him sure good but We will most certainly inform those who disbelieved of what they did and We will most certainly make them taste of hard chastisement
And when We show favor to man he turns aside and withdraws himself and when evil touches him he makes lengthy supplications
Say Tell me if it is from Allah then you disbelieve in it who is in greater error than he who is in a prolonged opposition
We will soon show them Our signs in the Universe and in their own souls until it will become quite clear to them that it is the truth
Is it not sufficient as regards your Lord that He is a witness over all things
Now surely they are in doubt as to the meeting of their Lord now surely He encompasses all things
Ha Mim
Ain Sin Qaf
Thus does Allah the Mighty the Wise reveal to you and thus He revealed to those before you
His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and He is the High the Great
The heavens may almost rend asunder from above them and the angels sing the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth now surely Allah is the Forgiving the Merciful
And as for those who take guardians besides Him Allah watches over them and you have not charge over them
And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Quran that you may warn the mother city and those around it and that you may give warning of the day of gathering together wherein is no doubt a party shall be in the garden and another party in the burning fire
And if Allah had pleased He would surely have made them a single community but He makes whom He pleases enter into His mercy and the unjust it is that shall have no guardian or helper
Or have they taken guardians besides Him
But Allah is the Guardian and He gives life to the dead and He has power over all things
And in whatever thing you disagree the judgment thereof is in Allah s hand that is Allah my Lord on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn time after time
The Originator of the heavens and the earth He made mates for you from among yourselves and mates of the cattle too multiplying you thereby nothing like a likeness of Him and He is the Hearing the Seeing
His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth He makes ample and straitens the means of subsistence for whom He pleases surely He is Cognizant of all things
He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that keep to obedience and be not divided therein hard to the unbelievers is that which you call them to Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases and guides to Himself him who turns to Him frequently
And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves and had not a word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term certainly judgment would have been given between them and those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most surely in disquieting doubt concerning it
To this then go on inviting and go on steadfastly on the right way as you are commanded and do not follow their low desires and say I believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book and I am commanded to do justice between you Allah is our Lord and your Lord we shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds no plea need there be now between us and you Allah will gather us together and to Him is the return
And as for those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered to Him their plea is null with their Lord and upon them is wrath and for them is severe punishment
Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth and the balance and what shall make you know that haply the hour be nigh
Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on and those who believe are in fear from it and they know that it is the truth
Now most surely those who dispute obstinately concerning the hour are in a great error
Allah is Benignant to His servants He gives sustenance to whom He pleases and He is the Strong the Mighty
Whoever desires the gain of the hereafter We will give him more of that gain and whoever desires the gain of this world We give him of it and in the hereafter he has no portion
Or have they associates who have prescribed for them any religion that Allah does not sanction
And were it not for the word of judgment decision would have certainly been given between them and surely the unjust shall have a painful punishment
You will see the unjust fearing on account of what they have earned and it must befall them and those who believe and do good shall be in the meadows of the gardens they shall have what they please with their Lord that is the great grace
That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants to those who believe and do good deeds Say I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives and whoever earns good We give him more of good therein surely Allah is Forgiving Grateful
Or do they say He has forged a lie against Allah But if Allah pleased He would seal your heart and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts
And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and He knows what you do
And He answers those who believe and do good deeds and gives them more out of His grace and as for the unbelievers they shall have a severe punishment
And if Allah should amplify the provision for His servants they would certainly revolt in the earth but He sends it down according to a measure as He pleases surely He is Aware of Seeing His servants
And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired and He unfolds His mercy and He is the Guardian the Praised One
And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has spread forth in both of them of living beings and when He pleases He is allpowerful to gather them together
And whatever affliction befalls you it is on account of what your hands have wrought and yet He pardons most of your faults
And you cannot escape in the earth and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah
And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains
If He pleases He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its back most surely there are signs in this for every patient grateful one
Or He may make them founder for what they have earned and even then pardon most
And that those who dispute about Our communications may know there is no place of refuge for them
So whatever thing you are given that is only a provision of this world s life and what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on their Lord
And those who shun the great sins and indecencies and whenever they are angry they forgive
And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer and their rule is to take counsel among themselves and who spend out of what We have given them
And those who when great wrong afflicts them defend themselves
And the recompense of evil is punishment like it but whoever forgives and amends he shall have his reward from Allah surely He does not love the unjust
And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed these it is against whom there is no way to blame
The way to blame is only against those who oppress men and revolt in the earth unjustly these shall have a painful punishment
And whoever is patient and forgiving these most surely are actions due to courage
And whomsoever Allah makes err he has no guardian after Him and you shall see the unjust when they see the punishment saying Is there any way to return
And you shall see them brought before it humbling themselves because of the abasements looking with a faint glance
And those who believe shall say Surely the losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the resurrection day
Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in lasting chastisement
And they shall have no friends to help them besides Allah and whomsoever Allah makes err he shall have no way
Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from Allah for which there shall be no averting you shall have no refuge on that day nor shall it be yours to make a denial
But if they turn aside We have not sent you as a watcher over them on you is only to deliver the message and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us he rejoices thereat and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done thensurely man is ungrateful
Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He creates what He pleases He grants to whom He pleases daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons
Or He makes them of both sorts male and female and He makes whom He pleases barren surely He is the Knowing the Powerful
And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil or by sending a messenger and revealing by His permission what He pleases surely He is High Wise
And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our command You did not know what the Book was nor what the faith was but We made it a light guiding thereby whom We please of Our servants and most surely you show the way to the right path
The path of Allah Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come
Ha Mim
I swear by the Book that makes things clear
Surely We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may understand
And surely it is in the original of the Book with Us truly elevated full of wisdom
What shall We then turn away the reminder from you altogether because you are an extravagant people
And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients
And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him
Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess and the case of the ancients has gone before
And if you should ask them Who created the heavens and the earth they would most certainly say The Mighty the Knowing One has created them
He Who made the earth a restingplace for you and made in it ways for you that you may go aright
And He Who sends down water from the cloud according to a measure then We raise to life thereby a dead country even thus shall you be brought forth
And He Who created pairs of all things and made for you of the ships and the cattle what you ride on
That you may firmly sit on their backs then remember the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon and say Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and we were not able to do it
And surely to our Lord we must return
And they assign to Him a part of His servants man to be sure is clearly ungrateful
What has He taken daughters to Himself of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons
And when one of them is given news of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent Allah his face becomes black and he is full of rage
What that which is made in ornaments and which in contention is unable to make plain speech
And they make the angels them who are the servants of the Beneficent Allah female divinities
What did they witness their creation
Their evidence shall be written down and they shall be questioned
And they say If the Beneficent Allah had pleased we should never have worshipped them
They have no knowledge of this they only lie
Or have We given them a book before it so that they hold fast to it
Nay they say We found our fathers on a course and surely we are guided by their footsteps
And thus We did not send before you any warner in a town but those who led easy lives in it said Surely we found our fathers on a course and surely we are followers of their footsteps
The warner said What even if I bring to you a better guide than that on which you found your fathers
They said Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent
So We inflicted retribution on them then see how was the end of the rejecters
And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people Surely I am clear of what you worship
Save Him Who created me for surely He will guide me
And he made it a word to continue in his posterity that they may return
Nay I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there came to them the truth and an Apostle making manifest the truth
And when there came to them the truth they said This is magic and surely we are disbelievers in it
And they say Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns
Will they distribute the mercy of your Lord We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world and We j have exalted some of them above others in degrees that some of them may take others in subjection and the mercy of your Lord is better than what they amass
And were it not that all people had been a single nation We would certainly have assigned to those who disbelieve in the Beneficent Allah to make of silver the roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend
And the doors of their houses and the couches on which they recline
And other embellishments of gold and all this is naught but provision of this world s life and the hereafter is with your Lord only for those who guard against evil
And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of the Beneficent Allah We appoint for him a Shaitan so he becomes his associate
And most surely they turn them away from the path and they think that they are guided aright
Until when he comes to Us he says O would that between me and you there were the distance of the East and the West so evil is the associate
And since you were unjust it will not profit you this day that you are sharers in the chastisement
What can you then make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and him who is in clear error
But if We should take you away still We shall inflict retribution on them
Rather We will certainly show you that which We have promised them for surely We are the possessors of full power over them
Therefore hold fast to that which has been revealed to you surely you are on the right path
And most surely it is a reminder for you and your people and you shall soon be questioned
And ask those of Our apostles whom We sent before you Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Beneficent Allah
And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications to Firon and his chiefs so he said Surely I am the apostle of the Lord of the worlds
But when he came to them with Our signs lo they laughed at them
And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than its like and We overtook them with chastisement that they may turn
And they said O magician call on your Lord for our sake as He has made the covenant with you we shall surely be the followers of the right way
But when We removed from them the chastisement lo they broke the pledge
And Firon proclaimed amongst his people O my people is not the kingdom of Egypt mine
And these rivers flow beneath me do you not then see
Nay I am better than this fellow who is contemptible and who can hardly speak distinctly
But why have not bracelets of gold been put upon him or why have there not come with him angels as companions
So he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him surely they were a transgressing people
Then when they displeased Us We inflicted a retribution on them so We drowned them all together
And We made them a precedent and example to the later generations
And when a description of the son of Marium is given lo your people raise a clamor thereat
And they say Are our gods better or is he
They do not set it forth to you save by way of disputation nay they are a contentious people
He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favor and We made him an example for the children of Israel
And if We please We could make among you angels to be successors in the land
And most surely it is a knowledge of the hour therefore have no doubt about it and follow me this is the right path
And let not the Shaitan prevent you surely he is your j open enemy
And when Isa came with clear arguments he said I have come to you indeed with wisdom and that I may make clear to you part of what you differ in so be careful of your duty to Allah and obey me
Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord therefore serve Him this is the right path
But parties from among them differed so woe to those who were unjust because of the chastisement of a painful day
Do they wait for aught but the hour that it should come upon them all of a sudden while they do not perceive
The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another except those who guard against evil
O My servants there is no fear for you this day nor shall you grieve
Those who believed in Our communications and were submissive
Enter the garden you and your wives you shall be made happy
There shall be sent round to them golden bowls and drinkingcups and therein shall be what their souls yearn after and wherein the eyes shall delight and you shall abide therein
And this is the garden which you are given as an inheritance on account of what you did
For you therein are many fruits of which you shall eat
Surely the guilty shall abide in the chastisement of hell
It shall not be abated from them and they shall therein be despairing
And We are not unjust to them but they themselves were unjust
And they shall call out O Malik let your Lord make an end of us
He shall say Surely you shall tarry
Certainly We have brought you the truth but most of you are averse to the truth
Or have they settled an affair
Then surely We are the settlers
Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal and their secret discourses
Aye and Our apostles with them write down
Say If the Beneficent Allah has a son I am the foremost of those who serve
Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth the Lord of power from what they describe
So leave them plunging into false discourses and sporting until they meet their day which they are threatened with
And He it is Who is Allah in the heavens and Allah in the earth and He is the Wise the Knowing
And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them and with Him is the knowledge of the hour and to Him shall you be brought back
And those whom they call upon besides Him have no authority for intercession but he who bears witness of the truth and they know him
And if you should ask them who created them they would certainly say Allah
Whence are they then turned back
Consider his cry O my Lord surely they are a people who do not believe
So turn away from them and say Peace for they shall soon come to know
Ha Mim
I swear by the Book that makes manifest the truth
Surely We revealed it on a blessed night surely We are ever warning
Therein every wise affair is made distinct
A command from Us surely We are the senders of apostles
A mercy from your Lord surely He is the Hearing the Knowing
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them if you would be sure
There is no god but He He gives life and causes death your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore
Nay they are in doubt they sport
Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring an evident smoke
That shall overtake men this is a painful punishment
Our Lord remove from us the punishment surely we are believers
How shall they be reminded and there came to them an Apostle making clear the truth
Yet they turned their backs on him and said One taught by others a madman
Surely We will remove the punishment a little but you will surely return to evil
On the day when We will seize them with the most violent seizing surely We will inflict retribution
And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon and there came to them a noble apostle
Saying Deliver to me the servants of Allah surely I am a faithful apostle to you
And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah surely I will bring to you a clear authority
And surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord that you should stone me to death
And if you do not believe in me then leave me alone
Then he called upon his Lord These are a guilty people
So go forth with My servants by night surely you will be pursued
And leave the sea intervening surely they are a host that shall be drowned
How many of the gardens and fountains have they left
And cornfields and noble places
And goodly things wherein they rejoiced
Thus it was and We gave them as a heritage to another people
So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them nor were they respited
And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement
From Firon surely he was haughty and one of the extravagant
And certainly We chose them having knowledge above the nations
And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear blessing
Most surely these do say
There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again
So bring our fathers back if you are truthful
Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them
We destroyed them for surely they were guilty
And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in sport
We did not create them both but with the truth but most of them do not know
Surely the day of separation is their appointed term of all of them
The day on which a friend shall not avail his friend aught nor shall they be helped
Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy surely He is the Mighty the Merciful
Surely the tree of the Zaqqum
Is the food of the sinful
Like dregs of oil it shall boil in their bellies
Like the boiling of hot water
Seize him then drag him down into the middle of the hell
Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water
Taste you forsooth are the mighty the honorable
Surely this is what you disputed about
Surely those who guard against evil are in a secure place
In gardens and springs
They shall wear of fine and thick silk sitting face to face
Thus shall it be and We will wed them with Houris pure beautiful ones
They shall call therein for every fruit in security
They shall not taste therein death except the first death and He will save them from the punishment of the hell
A grace from your Lord this is the great achievement
So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be mindful
Therefore wait surely they are waiting
Ha Mim
The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
Most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs for the believers
And in your own creation and in what He spreads abroad of animals there are signs for a people that are sure
And in the variation of the night and the day and in what Allah sends down of sustenance from the cloud then gives life thereby to the earth after its death and in the changing of the winds there are signs for a people who understand
These are the communications of Allah which We recite to you with truth then in what announcement would they believe after Allah and His communications
Woe to every sinful liar
Who hears the communications of Allah recited to him then persists proudly as though he had not heard them so announce to him a painful punishment
And when he comes to know of any of Our communications he takes it for a jest these it is that shall have abasing chastisement
Before them is hell and there shall not avail them aught of what they earned nor those whom they took for guardians besides Allah and they shall have a grievous punishment
This is guidance and as for those who disbelieve in the communications of their Lord they shall have a painful punishment on account of uncleanness
Allah is He Who made subservient to you the sea that the ships may run therein by His command and that you may seek of His grace and that you may give thanks
And He has made subservient to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth all from Himself most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect
Say to those who believe that they forgive those who do not fear the days of Allah that He may reward a people for what they earn
Whoever does good it is for his own soul and whoever does evil it is against himself then you shall be brought back to your Lord
And certainly We gave the Book and the wisdom and the prophecy to the children of Israel and We gave them of the goodly things and We made them excel the nations
And We gave them clear arguments in the affair but they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they differed
Then We have made you follow a course in the affair therefore follow it and do not follow the low desires of those who do not know
Surely they shall not avail you in the least against Allah and surely the unjust are friends of each other and Allah is the guardian of those who guard against evil
These are clear proofs for men and a guidance and a mercy for a people who are sure
Nay do those who have wrought evil deeds think that We will make them like those who believe and do good that their life and their death shall be equal Evil it is that they judge
And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
Have you then considered him who takes his low desire for his god and Allah has made him err having knowledge and has set a seal upon his ear and his heart and put a covering upon his eye
Who can then guide him after Allah
Will you not then be mindful
And they say There is nothing but our life in this world we live and die and nothing destroys us but time and they have no knowledge of that they only conjecture
And when Our clear communications are recited to them their argument is no other than that they say Bring our fathers back if you are truthful
Say Allah gives you life then He makes you die then will He gather you to the day of resurrection wherein is no doubt but most people do not know
And Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and on the day when the hour shall come to pass on that day shall they perish who say false things
And you shall see every nation kneeling down every nation shall be called to its book today you shall be rewarded for what you did
This is Our book that speaks against you with justice surely We wrote what you did
Then as to those who believed and did good their Lord will make them enter into His mercy that is the manifest achievement
As to those who disbelieved What were not My communications recited to you
But you were proud and you were a guilty people
And when it was said Surely the promise of Allah is true and as for the hour there is no doubt about it you said We do not know what the hour is we do not think that it will come to pass save a passing thought and we are not at all sure
And the evil consequences of what they did shall become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall encompass them
And it shall be said Today We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of this day of yours and your abode is the fire and there are not for you any helpers
That is because you took the communications of Allah for a jest and the life of this world deceived you
So on that day they shall not be brought forth from it nor shall they be granted goodwill
Therefore to Allah is due all praise the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth the Lord of the worlds
And to Him belongs greatness in the heavens and the earth and He is the Mighty the Wise
Ha Mim
The revelation of the Book is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two save with truth and for an appointed term and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are warned of
Say Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah
Show me what they have created of the earth or have they a share in the heavens Bring me a book before this or traces of knowledge if you are truthful
And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the day of resurrection and they are heedless of their call
And when men are gathered together they shall be their enemies and shall be deniers of their worshipping them
And when Our clear communications are recited to them those who disbelieve say with regard to the truth when it comes to them This is clear magic
Nay they say He has forged it Say If I have forged it you do not control anything for me from Allah He knows best what you utter concerning it He is enough as a witness between me and you and He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Say I am not the first of the apostles and I do not know what will be done with me or with you I do not follow anything but that which is revealed to me and I am nothing but a plain warner
Say Have you considered if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it and a witness from among the children of Israel has borne witness of one like it so he believed while you are big with pride surely Allah does not guide the unjust people
And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe If it had been a good they would not have gone ahead of us therein
And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby they say It is an old lie
And before it the Book of Musa was a guide and a mercy and this is a Book verifying it in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good
Surely those who say Our Lord is Allah then they continue on the right way they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
These are the dwellers of the garden abiding therein a reward for what they did
And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his parents with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months until when he attains his maturity and reaches forty years he says My Lord grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents and that I may do good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my offspring surely I turn to Thee and surely I am of those who submit
These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds among the dwellers of the garden the promise of truth which they were promised
And he who says to his parents Fie on you do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me
And they both call for Allah s aid Woe to you believe surely the promise of Allah is true But he says This is nothing but stories of the ancients
These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and the men that have already passed away before them surely they are losers
And for all are degrees according to what they did and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged
And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire You did away with your good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and because you transgressed
And mention the brother of Ad when he warned his people in the sandy plains and indeed warners came before him and after him saying Serve none but Allah surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day
They said Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods then bring us what you threaten us with if you are of the truthful ones
He said The knowledge is only with Allah and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent but I see you are a people who are ignorant
So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky advancing towards their valleys they said This is a cloud which will give us rain
Nay it is what you sought to hasten on a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment
Destroying everything by the command of its Lord so they became such that naught could be seen except their dwellings
Thus do We reward the guilty people
And certainly We had established them in what We have not established you in and We had given them ears and eyes and hearts but neither their ears nor their eyes nor their hearts availed them aught since they denied the communications of Allah and that which they mocked encompassed them
And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you and We repeat the communications that they might turn
Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods besides Allah to draw them nigh to Him
Nay they were lost to them and this was their lie and what they forged
And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn who listened to the Quran so when they came to it they said Be silent then when it was finished they turned back to their people warning them
They said O our people we have listened to a Book revealed after Musa verifying that which is before it guiding to the truth and to a right path
O our people accept the Divine caller and believe in Him He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment
And whoever does not accept theDivine caller he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him these are in manifest error
Have they not considered that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation is able to give life to the dead Aye
He has surely power over all things
And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the fire Is it not true
They shall say Aye by our Lord
He will say Then taste the punishment because you disbelieved
Therefore bear up patiently as did the apostles endowed with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to hasten for them their doom
On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not tarried save an hour of the day
A sufficient exposition
Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people
As for those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah s way He shall render their works ineffective
And as for those who believe and do good and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad and it is the very truth from their Lord He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition
That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and have given them their dowries taking them in marriage not fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret and whoever denies faith his work indeed is of no account and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers
So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve then smite the necks until when you have overcome them then make them prisoners and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates That shall be so and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them but that He may try some of you by means of others and as for those who are slain in the way of Allah He will by no means allow their deeds to perish
He will guide them and improve their condition
And cause them to enter the garden which He has made known to them
O you who believe if you help the cause of Allah He will help you and make firm your feet
And as for those who disbelieve for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective
That is because they hated what Allah revealed so He rendered their deeds null
Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them Allah brought down destruction upon them and the unbelievers shall have the like of it
That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe and because the unbelievers shall have no protector for them
Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good enter gardens beneath which rivers flow and those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as the beasts eat and the fire is their abode
And how many a town which was far more powerful than the town of yours which has driven you out We destroyed them so there was no helper for them
What is he who has a clear argument from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fairseeming and they follow their low desires
A parable of the garden which those guarding against evil are promised Therein are rivers of water that does not alter and rivers of milk the taste whereof does not change and rivers of drink delicious to those who drink and rivers of honey clarified and for them therein are all fruits and protection from their Lord
Are these like those who abide in the fire and who are made to drink boiling water so it rends their bowels asunder
And there are those of them who seek to listen to you until when they go forth from you they say to those who have been given the knowledge What was it that he said just now
These are they upon whose hearts Allah has set a seal and they follow their low desires
And as for those who follow the right direction He increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding against evil
Do they then wait for aught but the hour that it should come to them all of a sudden
Now indeed the tokens of it have already come but how shall they have their reminder when it comes on them
So know that there is no god but Allah and ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women and Allah knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding
And those who believe say Why has not a chapter been revealed
But when a decisive chapter is revealed and fighting is mentioned therein you see those in whose hearts is a disease look to you with the look of one fainting because of death
Woe to them then
Obedience and a gentle word was proper but when the affair becomes settled then if they remain true to Allah it would certainly be better for them
But if you held command you were sure to make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship
Those it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
Do they not then reflect on the Quran
Nay on the hearts there are locks
Surely as for those who return on their backs after that guidance has become manifest to them the Shaitan has made it a light matter to them and He gives them respite
That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed We will obey you in some of the affairs and Allah knows their secrets
But how will it be when the angels cause them to die smiting their backs
That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure therefore He has made null their deeds
Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not bring forth their spite
And if We please We would have made you know them so that you would certainly have recognized them by their marks and most certainly you can recognize them by the intent of their speech and Allah knows your deeds
And most certainly We will try you until We have known those among you who exert themselves hard and the patient and made your case manifest
Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah s way and oppose the Apostle after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm Allah in any way and He will make null their deeds
O you who believe obey Allah and obey the Apostle and do not make your deeds of no effect
Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah s way then they die while they are unbelievers Allah will by no means forgive them
And be not slack so as to cry for peace and you have the upper hand and Allah is with you and He will not bring your deeds to naught
The life of this world is only idle sport and play and if you believe and guard against evil He will give you your rewards and will not ask of you your possessions
If He should ask you for it and urge you you will be niggardly and He will bring forth your malice
Behold you are those who are called upon to spend in Allah s way but among you are those who are niggardly and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul and Allah is Selfsufficient and you have need of Him and if you turn back He will bring in your place another people then they will not be like you
Surely We have given to you a clear victory
That Allah may forgive your community their past faults and those to follow and complete His favor to you and keep you on a right way
And that Allah might help you with a mighty help
He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of the believers that they might have more of faith added to their faith and Allah s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Knowing Wise
That He may cause the believing men and the believing women to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein and remove from them their evil and that is a grand achievement with Allah
And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the polytheistic men and the polytheistic women the entertainers of evil thoughts about Allah On them is the evil turn and Allah is wroth with them and has cursed them and prepared hell for them and evil is the resort
And Allah s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Mighty Wise
Surely We have sent you as a witness and as a bearer of good news and as a warner
That you may believe in Allah and His Apostle and may aid him and revere him and that you may declare His glory morning and evening
Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear allegiance to Allah the hand of Allah is above their hands Therefore whoever breaks his faith he breaks it only to the injury of his own soul and whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah He will grant him a mighty reward
Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you Our property and our families kept us busy so ask forgiveness for us
They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts
Say Then who can control anything for you from Allah if He intends to do you harm or if He intends to do you good nay Allah is Aware of what you do
Nay you rather thought that the Apostle and the believers would not return to their families ever and that was made fairseeming to your hearts and you thought an evil thought and you were a people doomed to perish
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Apostle then surely We have prepared burning fire for the unbelievers
And Allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Those who are left behind will say when you set forth for the gaining of acquisitions Allow us that we may follow you
They desire to change the world of Allah
Say By no means shall you follow us thus did Allah say before
But they will say Nay you are jealous of us
Nay they do not understand but a little
Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind You shall soon be invited to fight against a people possessing mighty prowess you will fight against them until they submit then if you obey Allah will grant you a good reward and if you turn back as you turned back before He will punish you with a painful punishment
There is no harm in the blind nor is there any harm in the lame nor is there any harm in the sick if they do not go forth and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow and whoever turns back He will punish him with a painful punishment
Certainly Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree and He knew what was in their hearts so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory
And many acquisitions which they will take and Allah is Mighty Wise
Allah promised you many acquisitions which you will take then He hastened on this one for you and held back the hands of men from you and that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a right path
And others which you have not yet been able to achieve Allah has surely encompassed them and Allah has power over all things
And if those who disbelieve fight with you they would certainly turn their backs then they would not find any protector or a helper
Such has been the course of Allah that has indeed run before and you shall not find a change in Allah s course
And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them and Allah is Seeing what you do
It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and turned off the offering withheld from arriving at its destined place and were it not for the believing men and the believing women whom not having known you might have trodden down and thus something hateful might have afflicted you on their account without knowledge so that Allah may cause to enter into His mercy whomsoever He pleases had they been widely separated one from another We would surely have punished those who disbelieved from among them with a painful punishment
When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts feelings of disdain the disdain of the days of ignorance but Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Apostle and on the believers and made them keep the word of guarding against evil and they were entitled to it and worthy of it and Allah is Cognizant of all things
Certainly Allah had shown to His Apostle the vision with truth you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque if Allah pleases in security some having their heads shaved and others having their hair cut you shall not fear but He knows what you do not know so He brought about a near victory before that
He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions and Allah is enough for a witness
Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers compassionate among themselves you will see them bowing down prostrating themselves seeking grace from Allah and pleasure their marks are in their faces because of the effect of prostration that is their description in the Taurat and their description in the Injeel like as seedproduce that puts forth its sprout then strengthens it so it becomes stout and stands firmly on its stem delighting the sowers that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them Allah has promised those among them who believe and do good forgiveness and a great reward
O you who believe be not forward in the presence of Allah and His Apostle and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is Hearing Knowing
O you who believe do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet and do not speak loud to him as you speak loud to one another lest your deeds became null while you do not perceive
Surely those who lower their voices before Allah s Apostle are they whose hearts Allah has proved for guarding against evil they shall have forgiveness and a great reward
As for those who call out to you from behind the private chambers surely most of them do not understand
And if they wait patiently until you come out to them it would certainly be better for them and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe if an evildoer comes to you with a report look carefully into it lest you harm a people in ignorance then be sorry for what you have done
And know that among you is Allah s Apostle should he obey you in many a matter you would surely fall into distress but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it seemly in your hearts and He has made hateful to you unbelief and transgression and disobedience these it is that are the followers of a right way
By grace from Allah and as a favor and Allah is Knowing Wise
And if two parties of the believers quarrel make peace between them but if one of them acts wrongfully towards the other fight that which acts wrongfully until it returns to Allah s command then if it returns make peace between them with justice and act equitably surely Allah loves those who act equitably
The believers are but brethren therefore make peace between your brethren and be careful of your duty to Allah that mercy may be had on you
O you who believe let not one people laugh at another people perchance they may be better than they nor let women laugh at other women perchance they may be better than they and do not find fault with your own people nor call one another by nicknames evil is a bad name after faith and whoever does not turn these it is that are the unjust
O you who believe avoid most of suspicion for surely suspicion in some cases is a sin and do not spy nor let some of you backbite others Does one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother But you abhor it and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is Oftreturning to mercy Merciful
O you men surely We have created you of a male and a female and made you tribes and families that you may know each other surely the most honorable of you with Allah is the one among you most careful of his duty surely Allah is Knowing Aware
The dwellers of the desert say We believe Say You do not believe but say We submit and faith has not yet entered into your hearts and if you obey Allah and His Apostle He will not diminish aught of your deeds surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Apostle then they doubt not and struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah they are the truthful ones
Say Do you apprise Allah of your religion and Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and Allah is Cognizant of all things
They think that they lay you under an obligation by becoming Muslims
Say Lay me not under obligation by your Islam rather Allah lays you under an obligation by guiding you to the faith if you are truthful
Surely Allah knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth and Allah sees what you do
Qaf
I swear by the glorious Quran that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah
Nay they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves so the unbelievers say This is a wonderful thing
What when we are dead and have become dust
That is afar from probable return
We know indeed what the earth diminishes of them and with Us is a writing that preserves
Nay they rejected the truth when it came to them so they are now in a state of confusion
Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and it has no gaps
And the earth We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful kinds
To give sight and as a reminder to every servant who turns frequently to Allah
And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good then We cause to grow thereby gardens and the grain that is reaped
And the tall palmtrees having spadices closely set one above another
A sustenance for the servants and We give life thereby to a dead land thus is the rising
Others before them rejected prophets the people of Nuh and the dwellers of ArRass and Samood
And Ad and Firon and Lut s brethren
And the dwellers of the grove and the people of Tuba all rejected the apostles so My threat came to pass
Were We then fatigued with the first creation
Yet are they in doubt with regard to a new creation
And certainly We created man and We know what his mind suggests to him and We are nearer to him than his lifevein
When the two receivers receive sitting on the right and on the left
He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher at hand
And the stupor of death will come in truth that is what you were trying to escape
And the trumpet shall be blown that is the day of the threatening
And every soul shall come with it a driver and a witness
Certainly you were heedless of it but now We have removed from you your veil so your sight today is sharp
And his companions shall say This is what is ready with me
Do cast into hell every ungrateful rebellious one
Forbidder of good exceeder of limits doubter
Who sets up another god with Allah so do cast him into severe chastisement
His companion will say Our Lord
I did not lead him into inordinacy but he himself was in a great error
He will say Do not quarrel in My presence and indeed I gave you the threatening beforehand
My word shall not be changed nor am I in the least unjust to the servants
On the day that We will say to hell Are you filled up And it will say Are there any more
And the garden shall be brought near to those who guard against evil not far off
This is what you were promised it is for every one who turns frequently to Allah keeps His limits
Who fears the Beneficent Allah in secret and comes with a penitent heart
Enter it in peace that is the day of abiding
They have therein what they wish and with Us is more yet
And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess than they so they went about and about in the lands Is there a place of refuge
Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and is a witness
And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not any fatigue
Therefore be patient of what they say and sing the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting
And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers
And listen on the day when the crier shall cry from a near place
The day when they shall hear the cry in truth that is the day of coming forth
Surely We give life and cause to die and to Us is the eventual coming
The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under them they will make haste that is a gathering together easy to Us
We know best what they say and you are not one to compel them therefore remind him by means of the Quran who fears My threat
I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide
Then those clouds bearing the load of minute things in space
Then those ships that glide easily
Then those angels who distribute blessings by Our command
What you are threatened with is most surely true
And the judgment must most surely come about
I swear by the heaven full of ways
Most surely you are at variance with each other in what you say
He is turned away from it who would be turned away
Cursed be the liars
Who are in a gulf of ignorance neglectful
They ask When is the day of judgment
It is the day on which they shall be tried at the fire
Taste your persecution this is what you would hasten on
Surely those who guard against evil shall be in gardens and fountains
Taking what their Lord gives them surely they were before that the doers of good
They used to sleep but little in the night
And in the morning they asked forgiveness
And in their property was a portion due to him who begs and to him who is denied good
And in the earth there are signs for those who are sure
And in your own souls too will you not then see
And in the heaven is your sustenance and what you are threatened with
And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth it is most surely the truth just as you do speak
Has there come to you information about the honored guests of Ibrahim
When they entered upon him they said Peace Peace said he a strange people
Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought a fat roasted calf
So he brought it near them He said What will you not eat
So he conceived in his mind a fear on account of them
They said Fear not And they gave him the good news of a boy possessing knowledge
Then his wife came up in great grief and she struck her face and said An old barren woman
They said Thus says your Lord Surely He is the Wise the Knowing
He said What is your affair then O apostles
They said Surely we are sent to a guilty people
That we may send down upon them stone of clay
Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant
Then We brought forth such as were therein of the believers
But We did not find therein save a single house of those who submitted the Muslims
And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
And in Musa When We sent him to Firon with clear authority
But he turned away with his forces and said A magician or a mad man
So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and he was blamable
And in Ad When We sent upon them the destructive wind
It did not leave aught on which it blew but it made it like ashes
And in Samood When it was said to them Enjoy yourselves for a while
But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord so the rumbling overtook them while they saw
So they were not able to rise up nor could they defend themselves
And the people of Nuh before surely they were a transgressing people
And the heaven We raised it high with power and most surely We are the makers of things ample
And the earth We have made it a wide extent how well have We then spread it out
And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful
Therefore fly to Allah surely I am a plain warner to you from Him
And do not set up with Allah another god surely I am a plain warner to you from Him
Thus there did not come to those before them an apostle but they said A magician or a mad man
Have they charged each other with this
Nay they are an inordinate people
Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame
And continue to remind for surely the reminder profits the believers
And I have not created the jinn and the men except that they should serve Me
I do not desire from them any sustenance and I do not desire that they should feed Me
Surely Allah is the Bestower of sustenance the Lord of Power the Strong
So surely those who are unjust shall have a portion like the portion of their companions therefore let them not ask Me to hasten on
Therefore woe to those who disbelieve because of their day which they are threatened with
I swear by the Mountain
And the Book written
In an outstretched fine parchment
And the House Kaaba that is visited
And the elevated canopy
And the swollen sea
Most surely the punishment of your Lord will come to pass
There shall be none to avert it
On the day when the heaven shall move from side to side
And the mountains shall pass away passing away altogether
So woe on that day to those who reject the truth
Those who sport entering into vain discourses
The day on which they shall be driven away to the fire of hell with violence
This is the fire which you used to give the lie to
Is it magic then or do you not see
Enter into it then bear it patiently or do not bear it patiently it is the same to you you shall be requited only for what you did
Surely those who guard against evil shall be in gardens and bliss
Rejoicing because of what their Lord gave them and their Lord saved them from the punishment of the burning fire
Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did
Reclining on thrones set in lines and We will unite them to largeeyed beautiful ones
And as for those who believe and their offspring follow them in faith We will unite with them their offspring and We will not diminish to them aught of their work every man is responsible for what he shall have wrought
And We will aid them with fruit and flesh such as they desire
They shall pass therein from one to another a cup wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin
And round them shall go boys of theirs as if they were hidden pearls
And some of them shall advance towards others questioning each other
Saying Surely we feared before on account of our families
But Allah has been gracious to us and He has saved us from the punishment of the hot wind
Surely we called upon Him before Surely He is the Benign the Merciful
Therefore continue to remind for by the grace of your Lord you are not a soothsayer or a madman
Or do they say A poet we wait for him the evil accidents of time
Say Wait for surely I too with you am of those who wait
Nay do their understandings bid them this
Or are they an inordinate people
Or do they say He has forged it
Nay they do not believe
Then let them bring an announcement like it if they are truthful
Or were they created without there being anything or are they the creators
Or did they create the heavens and the earth
Nay they have no certainty
Or have they the treasures of your Lord with them
Or have they been set in absolute authority
Or have they the means by which they listen
Then let their listener bring a clear authority
Or has He daughters while you have sons
Or do you ask them for a reward so that they are overburdened by a debt
Or have they the unseen so that they write it down
Or do they desire a war
But those who disbelieve shall be the vanquished ones in war
Or have they a god other than Allah
Glory be to Allah from what they set up with Him
And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming down they would say Piled up clouds
Leave them then till they meet that day of theirs wherein they shall be made to swoon with terror
The day on which their struggle shall not avail them aught nor shall they be helped
And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that in the world but most of them do not know
And wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord for surely you are before Our eyes and sing the praise of your Lord when you rise
And in the night give Him glory too and at the setting of the stars
I swear by the star when it goes down
Your companion does not err nor does he go astray
Nor does he speak out of desire
It is naught but revelation that is revealed
The Lord of Mighty Power has taught him
The Lord of Strength so he attained completion
And he is in the highest part of the horizon
Then he drew near then he bowed
So he was the measure of two bows or closer still
And He revealed to His servant what He revealed
The heart was not untrue in making him see what he saw
What do you then dispute with him as to what he saw
And certainly he saw him in another descent
At the farthest lotetree
Near which is the garden the place to be resorted to
When that which covers covered the lotetree
The eye did not turn aside nor did it exceed the limit
Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord
Have you then considered the Lat and the Uzza
And Manat the third the last
What for you the males and for Him the females
This indeed is an unjust division
They are naught but names which you have named you and your fathers Allah has not sent for them any authority They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which their souls incline to and certainly the guidance has come to them from their Lord
Or shall man have what he wishes
Nay for Allah is the hereafter and the former life
And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He pleases and chooses
Most surely they who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with female names
And they have no knowledge of it they do not follow anything but conjecture and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all
Therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder and does not desire anything but this world s life
That is their goal of knowledge surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction
And Allah s is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do and that He may reward those who do good with goodness
Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies but the passing idea surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs of your mothers therefore do not attribute purity to your souls He knows him best who guards against evil
Have you then seen him who turns his back
And gives a little and then withholds
Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see
Or has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Musa
And of Ibrahim who fulfilled the commandments
That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another
And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for
And that his striving shall soon be seen
Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward
And that to your Lord is the goal
And that He it is Who makes men laugh and makes them weep
And that He it is Who causes death and gives life
And that He created pairs the male and the female
From the small seed when it is adapted
And that on Him is the bringing forth a second time
And that He it is Who enriches and gives to hold
And that He is the Lord of the Sirius
And that He did destroy the Ad of old
And Samood so He spared not
And the people of Nuh before surely they were most unjust and inordinate
And the overthrown cities did He overthrow
So there covered them that which covered
Which of your Lord s benefits will you then dispute about
This is a warner of the warners of old
The near event draws nigh
There shall be none besides Allah to remove it
Do you then wonder at this announcement
And will you laugh and not weep
While you are indulging in varieties
So make obeisance to Allah and serve Him
The hour drew nigh and the moon did rend asunder
And if they see a miracle they turn aside and say Transient magic
And they call it a lie and follow their low desires and every affair has its appointed term
And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is prevention
Consummate wisdom but warnings do not avail
So turn your back on them for the day when the inviter shall invite them to a hard task
Their eyes cast down going forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts
Hastening to the inviter The unbelievers shall say This is a hard day
Before them the people of Nuh rejected so they rejected Our servant and called him mad and he was driven away
Therefore he called upon his Lord I am overcome come Thou then to help
So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring
And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs so the water gathered together according to a measure already ordained
And We bore him on that which was made of planks and nails
Sailing before Our eyes a reward for him who was denied
And certainly We left it as a sign but is there anyone who
How great was then My punishment and My warning
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance but is there anyone who will mind
Ad treated the truth as a lie so how great was My punishment and My warning
Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter illluck
Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palmtrees torn up
How great was then My punishment and My warning
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance but is there anyone who will mind
Samood rejected the warning
So they said What a single mortal from among us Shall we follow him
Most surely we shall in that case be in sure error and distress
Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among us
Nay he is an insolent liar
Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar the insolent one
Surely We are going to send the shecamel as a trial for them therefore watch them and have patience
And inform them that the water is shared between them every share of the water shall be regulated
But they called their companion so he took the sword and slew her
How great was then My punishment and My warning
Surely We sent upon them a single cry so they were like the dry fragments of trees which the maker of an enclosure collects
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance but is there anyone who will mind
The people of Lut treated the warning as a lie
Surely We sent upon them a stonestorm except Lut s followers We saved them a little before daybreak
A favor from Us thus do We reward him who gives thanks
And certainly he warned them of Our violent seizure but they obstinately disputed the warning
And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his guests but We blinded their eyes so taste My chastisement and My warning
And certainly a lasting chastisement overtook them in the morning
So taste My chastisement and My warning
And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance but is there anyone who will mind
And certainly the warning came to Firon s people
They rejected all Our communications so We overtook them after the manner of a Mighty Powerful One
Are the unbelievers of yours better than these or is there an exemption for you in the scriptures
Or do they say We are a host allied together to help each other
Soon shall the hosts be routed and they shall turn their backs
Nay the hour is their promised time and the hour shall be most grievous and bitter
Surely the guilty are in error and distress
On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces into the fire taste the touch of hell
Surely We have created everything according to a measure
And Our command is but one as the twinkling of an eye
And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you but is there anyone who will mind
And everything they have done is in the writings
And everything small and great is written down
Surely those who guard against evil shall be in gardens and rivers
In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King
The Beneficent Allah
Taught the Quran
He created man
Taught him the mode of expression
The sun and the moon follow a reckoning
And the herbs and the trees do prostrate to Him
And the heaven He raised it high and He made the balance
That you may not be inordinate in respect of the measure
And keep up the balance with equity and do not make the measure deficient
And the earth He has set it for living creatures
Therein is fruit and palms having sheathed clusters
And the grain with its husk and fragrance
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels
And He created the jinn of a flame of fire
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Lord of the East and Lord of the West
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
He has made the two seas to flow freely so that they meet together
Between them is a barrier which they cannot pass
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
There come forth from them pearls both large and small
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
And His are the ships reared aloft in the sea like mountains
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Everyone on it must pass away
And there will endure for ever the person of your Lord the Lord of glory and honor
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
All those who are in the heavens and the earth ask of Him every moment He is in a state of glory
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Soon will We apply Ourselves to you O you two armies
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
O assembly of the jinn and the men
If you are able to pass through the regions of the heavens and the earth then pass through you cannot pass through but with authority
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
The flames of fire and smoke will be sent on you two then you will not be able to defend yourselves
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
And when the heaven is rent asunder and then becomes red like red hide
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
So on that day neither man nor jinni shall be asked about his sin
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
The guilty shall be recognized by their marks so they shall be seized by the forelocks and the feet
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
This is the hell which the guilty called a lie
Round about shall they go between it and hot boiling water
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
And for him who fears to stand before his Lord are two gardens
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Having in them various kinds
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In both of them are two fountains flowing
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In both of them are two pairs of every fruit
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Reclining on beds the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In them shall be those who restrained their eyes before them neither man nor jinni shall have touched them
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
As though they were rubies and pearls
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Is the reward of goodness aught but goodness
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
And besides these two are two other gardens
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Both inclining to blackness
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In both of them are two springs gushing forth
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In both are fruits and palms and pomegranates
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
In them are goodly things beautiful ones
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Pure ones confined to the pavilions
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Man has not touched them before them nor jinni
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets
Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
Blessed be the name of your Lord the Lord of Glory and Honor
When the great event comes to pass
There is no belying its coming to pass
Abasing one party exalting the other
When the earth shall be shaken with a severe shaking
And the mountains shall be made to crumble with an awful crumbling
So that they shall be as scattered dust
And you shall be three sorts
Then as to the companions of the right hand how happy are the companions of the right hand
And as to the companions of the left hand how wretched are the companions of the left hand
And the foremost are the foremost
These are they who are drawn nigh to Allah
In the gardens of bliss
A numerous company from among the first
And a few from among the latter
On thrones decorated
Reclining on them facing one another
Round about them shall go youths never altering in age
With goblets and ewers and a cup of pure drink
They shall not be affected with headache thereby nor shall they get exhausted
And fruits such as they choose
And the flesh of fowl such as they desire
And pure beautiful ones
The like of the hidden pearls
A reward for what they used to do
They shall not hear therein vain or sinful discourse
Except the word peace peace
And the companions of the right hand how happy are the companions of the right hand
Amid thornless lotetrees
And bananatrees with fruits one above another
And extended shade
And water flowing constantly
And abundant fruit
Neither intercepted nor forbidden
And exalted thrones
Surely We have made them to grow into a new growth
Then We have made them virgins
Loving equals in age
For the sake of the companions of the right hand
A numerous company from among the first
And a numerous company from among the last
And those of the left hand how wretched are those of the left hand
In hot wind and boiling water
And the shade of black smoke
Neither cool nor honorable
Surely they were before that made to live in ease and plenty
And they persisted in the great violation
And they used to say What when we die and have become dust and bones shall we then indeed be raised
Or our fathers of yore
Say The first and the last
Shall most surely be gathered together for the appointed hour of a known day
Then shall you O you who err and call it a lie
Most surely eat of a tree of Zaqqoom
And fill your bellies with it
Then drink over it of boiling water
And drink as drinks the thirsty camel
This is their entertainment on the day of requital
We have created you why do you not then assent
Have you considered the seed
Is it you that create it or are We the creators
We have ordained death among you and We are not to be overcome
In order that We may bring in your place the likes of you and make you grow into what you know not
And certainly you know the first growth why do you not then mind
Have you considered what you sow
Is it you that cause it to grow or are We the causers of growth
If We pleased We should have certainly made it broken down into pieces then would you begin to lament
Surely we are burdened with debt
Nay we are deprived
Have you considered the water which you drink
Is it you that send it down from the clouds or are We the senders
If We pleased We would have made it salty why do you not then give thanks
Have you considered the fire which you strike
Is it you that produce the trees for it or are We the producers
We have made it a reminder and an advantage for the wayfarers of the desert
Therefore glorify the name of your Lord the Great
But nay I swear by the falling of stars
And most surely it is a very great oath if you only knew
Most surely it is an honored Quran
In a book that is protected
None shall touch it save the purified ones
A revelation by the Lord of the worlds
Do you then hold this announcement in contempt
And to give it the lie you make your means of subsistence
Why is it not then that when it soul comes up to the throat
And you at that time look on
And We are nearer to it than you but you do not see
Then why is it not if you are not held under authority
That you send it not back if you are truthful
Then if he is one of those drawn nigh to Allah
Then happiness and bounty and a garden of bliss
And if he is one of those on the right hand
Then peace to you from those on the right hand
And if he is one of the rejecters the erring ones
He shall have an entertainment of boiling water
And burning in hell
Most surely this is a certain truth
Therefore glorify the name of your Lord the Great
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah and He is the Mighty the Wise
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth He gives life and causes death and He has power over all things
He is the First and the Last and the Ascendant over all and the Knower of hidden things and He is Cognizant of all things
He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six periods and He is firm in power He knows that which goes deep down into the earth and that which comes forth out of it and that which comes down from the heaven and that which goes up into it and He is with you wherever you are and Allah sees what you do
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to Allah are all affairs returned
He causes the night to enter in upon the day and causes the day to enter in upon the night and He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts
Believe in Allah and His Apostle and spend out of what He has made you to be successors of for those of you who believe and spend shall have a great reward
And what reason have you that you should not believe in Allah
And the Apostle calls on you that you may believe in your Lord and indeed He has made a covenant with you if you are believers
He it is who sends down clear communications upon His servant that he may bring you forth from utter darkness into light and most surely Allah is Kind Merciful to you
And what reason have you that you should not spend in Allah s way And Allah s is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth not alike among you are those who spent before the victory and fought and those who did not they are more exalted in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards and Allah has promised good to all and Allah is Aware of what you do
Who is there that will offer to Allah a good gift so He will double it for him and he shall have an excellent reward
On that day you will see the faithful men and the faithful women their light running before them and on their right hand good news for you today gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein that is the grand achievement
On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say to those who believe Wait for us that we may have light from your light it shall be said Turn back and seek a light
Then separation would be brought about between them with a wall having a door in it as for the inside of it there shall be mercy in it and as for the outside of it before it there shall be punishment
They will cry out to them Were we not with you They shall say Yea but you caused yourselves to fall into temptation and you waited and doubted and vain desires deceived you till the threatened punishment of Allah came while the archdeceiver deceived you about Allah
So today ransom shall not be accepted from you nor from those who disbelieved your abode is the fire it is your friend and evil is the resort
Has not the time yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth
And that they should not be like those who were given the Book before but the time became prolonged to them so their hearts hardened and most of them are transgressors
Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death indeed We have made the communications clear to you that you may understand
Surely as for the charitable men and the charitable women and those who set apart for Allah a goodly portion it shall be doubled for them and they shall have a noble reward
And as for those who believe in Allah and His apostles these it is that are the truthful and the faithful ones in the sight of their Lord they shall have their reward and their light and as for those who disbelieve and reject Our communications these are the inmates of the hell
Know that this world s life is only sport and play and gaiety and boasting among yourselves and a vying in the multiplication of wealth and children like the rain whose causing the vegetation to grow pleases the husbandmen then it withers away so that you will see it become yellow then it becomes dried up and broken down and in the hereafter is a severe chastisement and also forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure and this world s life is naught but means of deception
Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden the extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the heaven and the earth it is prepared for those who believe in Allah and His apostles that is the grace of Allah He gives it to whom He pleases and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
No evil befalls on the earth nor in your own souls but it is in a book before We bring it into existence surely that is easy to Allah
So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you nor be exultant at what He has given you and Allah does not love any arrogant boaster
Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on men and whoever turns back then surely Allah is He Who is the Selfsufficient the Praised
Certainly We sent Our apostles with clear arguments and sent down with them the Book and the balance that men may conduct themselves with equity and We have made the iron wherein is great violence and advantages to men and that Allah may know who helps Him and His apostles in the secret surely Allah is Strong Mighty
And certainly We sent Nuh and Ibrahim and We gave to their offspring the gift of prophecy and the Book so there are among them those who go aright and most of them are transgressors
Then We made Our apostles to follow in their footsteps and We sent Isa son of Marium afterwards and We gave him the Injeel and We put in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy and as for monkery they innovated it We did not prescribe it to them only to seek Allah s pleasure but they did not observe it with its due observance so We gave to those of them who believed their reward and most of them are transgressors
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah and believe in His Apostle He will give you two portions of His mercy and make for you a light with which you will walk and forgive you and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
So that the followers of the Book may know that they do not control aught of the grace of Allah and that grace is in Allah s hand He gives it to whom He pleases and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
Allah indeed knows the plea of her who pleads with you about her husband and complains to Allah and Allah knows the contentions of both of you surely Allah is Hearing Seeing
As for those of you who put away their wives by likening their backs to the backs of their mothers they are not their mothers their mothers are no others than those who gave them birth and most surely they utter a hateful word and a falsehood and most surely Allah is Pardoning Forgiving
And as for those who put away their wives by likening their backs to the backs of their mothers then would recall what they said they should free a captive before they touch each other to that you are admonished to conform and Allah is Aware of what you do
But whoever has not the means let him fast for two months successively before they touch each other then as for him who is not able let him feed sixty needy ones that is in order that you may have faith in Allah and His Apostle and these are Allah s limits and the unbelievers shall have a painful punishment
Surely those who act in opposition to Allah and His Apostle shall be laid down prostrate as those before them were laid down prostrate and indeed We have revealed clear communications and the unbelievers shall have an abasing chastisement
On the day when Allah will raise them up all together then inform them of what they did Allah has recorded it while they have forgotten it and Allah is a witness of all things
Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth Nowhere is there a secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of them nor between five but He is the sixth of them nor less than that nor more but He is with them wheresoever they are then He will inform them of what they did on the day of resurrection surely Allah is Cognizant of all things
Have you not seen those who are forbidden secret counsels then they return to what they are forbidden and they hold secret counsels for sin and revolt and disobedience to the Apostle and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet you and they say in themselves Why does not Allah punish us for what we say Hell is enough for them they shall enter it and evil is the resort
O you who believe when you confer together in private do not give to each other counsel of sin and revolt and disobedience to the Apostle and give to each other counsel of goodness and guarding against evil and be careful of your duty to Allah to Whom you shall be gathered together
Secret counsels are only the work of the Shaitan that he may cause to grieve those who believe and he cannot hurt them in the least except with Allah s permission and on Allah let the believers rely
O you who believe when it is said to you Make room in your assemblies then make ample room Allah will give you ample and when it is said Rise up then rise up
Allah will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge in high degrees and Allah is Aware of what you do
O you who believe when you consult the Apostle then offer something in charity before your consultation that is better for you and purer but if you do not find then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Do you fear that you will not be able to give in charity before your consultation
So when you do not do it and Allah has turned to you mercifully then keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and obey Allah and His Apostle and Allah is Aware of what you do
Have you not seen those who befriend a people with whom Allah is wroth
They are neither of you nor of them and they swear falsely while they know
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment surely what they do is evil
They make their oaths to serve as a cover so they turn away from Allah s way therefore they shall have an abasing chastisement
Neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them aught against Allah they are the inmates of the fire therein they shall abide
On the day that Allah will raise them up all then they will swear to Him as they swear to you and they think that they have something now surely they are the liars
The Shaitan has gained the mastery over them so he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah they are the Shaitan s party now surely the Shaitan s party are the losers
Surely as for those who are in opposition to Allah and His Apostle they shall be among the most abased
Allah has written down I will most certainly prevail I and My apostles surely Allah is Strong Mighty
You shall not find a people who believe in Allah and the latter day befriending those who act in opposition to Allah and His Apostle even though they were their own fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk these are they into whose hearts He has impressed faith and whom He has strengthened with an inspiration from Him and He will cause them to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein Allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with Him these are Allah s party now surely the party of Allah are the successful ones
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah and He is the Mighty the Wise
He it is Who caused those who disbelieved of the followers of the Book to go forth from their homes at the first banishment you did not think that they would go forth while they were certain that their fortresses would defend them against Allah but Allah came to them whence they did not expect and cast terror into their hearts they demolished their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers therefore take a lesson O you who have eyes
And had it not been that Allah had decreed for them the exile He would certainly have punished them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have chastisement of the fire
That is because they acted in opposition to Allah and His Apostle and whoever acts in opposition to Allah then surely Allah is severe in retributing evil
Whatever palmtree you cut down or leave standing upon its roots It is by Allah s command and that He may abase the transgressors
And whatever Allah restored to His Apostle from them you did not press forward against it any horse or a riding camel but Allah gives authority to His apostles against whom He pleases and Allah has power over all things
Whatever Allah has restored to His Apostle from the people of the towns it is for Allah and for the Apostle and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer so that it may not be a thing taken by turns among the rich of you and whatever the Apostle gives you accept it and from whatever he forbids you keep back and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is severe in retributing evil
It is for the poor who fled their homes and their possessions seeking grace of Allah and His pleasure and assisting Allah and His Apostle these it is that are the truthful
And those who made their abode in the city and in the faith before them love those who have fled to them and do not find in their hearts a need of what they are given and prefer them before themselves though poverty may afflict them and whoever is preserved from the niggardliness of his soul these it is that are the successful ones
And those who come after them say Our Lord forgive us and those of our brethren who had precedence of us in faith and do not allow any spite to remain in our hearts towards those who believe our Lord surely Thou art Kind Merciful
Have you not seen those who have become hypocrites They say to those of their brethren who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book If you are driven forth we shall certainly go forth with you and we will never obey any one concerning you and if you are fought against we will certainly help you and Allah bears witness that they are most surely liars
Certainly if these are driven forth they will not go forth with them and if they are fought against they will not help them and even if they helpthem they will certainly turn their backs then they shall not be helped
You are certainly greater in being feared in their hearts than Allah that is because they are a people who do not understand
They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified towns or from behind walls their fighting between them is severe you may think them as one body and their hearts are disunited that is because they are a people who have no sense
Like those before them shortly they tasted the evil result of their affair and they shall have a painful punishment
Like the Shaitan when he says to man Disbelieve but when he disbelieves he says I am surely clear of you surely I fear Allah the Lord of the worlds
Therefore the end of both of them is that they are both in the fire to abide therein and that is the reward of the unjust
O you who believe be careful of your duty to Allah and let every soul consider what it has sent on for the morrow and be careful of your duty to Allah surely Allah is Aware of what you do
And be not like those who forsook Allah so He made them forsake their own souls these it is that are the transgressors
Not alike are the inmates of the fire and the dwellers of the garden the dwellers of the garden are they that are the achievers
Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain you would certainly have seen it falling down splitting asunder because of the fear of Allah and We set forth these parables to men that they may reflect
He is Allah besides Whom there is no god the Knower of the unseen and the seen He is the Beneficent the Merciful
He is Allah besides Whom there is no god the King the Holy the Giver of peace the Granter of security Guardian over all the Mighty the Supreme the Possessor of every greatness Glory be to Allah from what they set up with Him
He is Allah the Creator the Maker the Fashioner His are the most excellent names whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares His glory and He is the Mighty the Wise
O you who believe do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends would you offer them love while they deny what has come to you of the truth driving out the Apostle and yourselves because you believe in Allah your Lord If you go forth struggling hard in My path and seeking My pleasure would you manifest love to them And I know what you conceal and what you manifest and whoever of you does this he indeed has gone astray from the straight path
If they find you they will be your enemies and will stretch forth towards you their hands and their tongues with evil and they ardently desire that you may disbelieve
Your relationship would not profit you nor your children on the day of resurrection He will decide between you and Allah sees what you do
Indeed there is for you a good example in Ibrahim and those with him when they said to their people Surely we are clear of you and of what you serve besides Allah we declare ourselves to be clear of you and enmity and hatred have appeared between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone but not in what Ibrahim said to his father I would certainly ask forgiveness for you and I do not control for you aught from Allah Our Lord on Thee do we rely and to Thee do we turn and to Thee is the eventual coming
Our Lord do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve and forgive us our Lord surely Thou art the Mighty the Wise
Certainly there is for you in them a good example for him who fears Allah and the last day and whoever turns back then surely Allah is the Selfsufficient the Praised
It may be that Allah will bring about friendship between you and those whom you hold to be your enemies among them and Allah is Powerful and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Allah does not forbid you respecting those who have not made war against you on account of your religion and have not driven you forth from your homes that you show them kindness and deal with them justly surely Allah loves the doers of justice
Allah only forbids you respecting those who made war upon you on account of your religion and drove you forth from your homes and backed up others in your expulsion that you make friends with them and whoever makes friends with them these are the unjust
O you who believe when believing women come to you flying then examine them Allah knows best their faith then if you find them to be believing women do not send them back to the unbelievers neither are these women lawful for them nor are those men lawful for them and give them what they have spent and no blame attaches to you in marrying them when you give them their dowries and hold not to the ties of marriage of unbelieving women and ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent That is Allah s judgment He judges between you and Allah is Knowing Wise
And if anything out of the dowries of your wives has passed away from you to the unbelievers then your turn comes give to those whose wives have gone away the like of what they have spent and be careful of your duty to Allah in Whom you believe
O Prophet when believing women come to you giving you a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah and will not steal and will not commit fornication and will not kill their children and will not bring a calumny which they have forged of themselves and will not disobey you in what is good accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them from Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who believe do not make friends with a people with whom Allah is wroth indeed they despair of the hereafter as the unbelievers despair of those in tombs
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah and He is the Mighty the Wise
O you who believe why do you say that which you do not do
It is most hateful to Allah that you should say that which you do not do
Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way in ranks as if they were a firm and compact wall
And when Musa said to his people O my people why do you give me trouble And you know indeed that I am Allah s apostle to you but when they turned aside Allah made their hearts turn aside and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
And when Isa son of Marium said O children of Israel surely I am the apostle of Allah to you verifying that which is before me of the Taurat and giving the good news of an Apostle who will come after me his name being Ahmad but when he came to them with clear arguments they said This is clear magic
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah and he is invited to Islam and Allah does not guide the unjust people
They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah will perfect His light though the unbelievers may be averse
He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it overcome the religions all of them though the polytheists may be averse
O you who believe shall I lead you to a merchandise which may deliver you from a painful chastisement
You shall believe in Allah and His Apostle and struggle hard in Allah s way with your property and your lives that is better for you did you but know
He will forgive you your faults and cause you to enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetuity that is the mighty achievement
And yet another blessing that you love help from Allah and a victory near at hand and give good news to the believers
O you who believe be helpers in the cause of Allah as Isa son of Marium said to his disciples Who are my helpers in the cause of Allah The disciples said We are helpers in the cause of Allah
So a party of the children of Israel believed and another party disbelieved then We aided those who believed against their enemy and they became uppermost
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah the King the Holy the Mighty the Wise
He it is Who raised among the inhabitants of Mecca an Apostle from among themselves who recites to them His communications and purifies them and teaches them the Book and the Wisdom although they were before certainly in clear error
And others from among them who have not yet joined them and He is the Mighty the Wise
That is Allah s grace He grants it to whom He pleases and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace
The likeness of those who were charged with the Taurat then they did not observe it is as the likeness of the ass bearing books evil is the likeness of the people who reject the communications of Allah and Allah does not guide the unjust people
Say O you who are Jews if you think that you are the favorites of Allah to the exclusion of other people then invoke death If you are truthful
And they will never invoke it because of what their hands have sent before and Allah is Cognizant of the unjust
Say As for the death from which you flee that will surely overtake you then you shall be sent back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of that which you did
O you who believe when the call is made for prayer on Friday then hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave off trading that is better for you if you know
But when the prayer is ended then disperse abroad in the land and seek of Allah s grace and remember Allah much that you may be successful
And when they see merchandise or sport they break up for It and leave you standing Say What is with Allah is better than sport and better than merchandise and Allah is the best of Sustainers
When the hypocrites come to you they say We bear witness that you are most surely Allah s Apostle and Allah knows that you are most surely His Apostle and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are surely liars
They make their oaths a shelter and thus turn away from Allah s way surely evil is that which they do
That is because they believe then disbelieve so a seal is set upon their hearts so that they do not understand
And when you see them their persons will please you and If they speak you will listen to their speech they are as if they were big pieces of wood clad with garments they think every cry to be against them They are the enemy therefore beware of them may Allah destroy them whence are they turned back
And when it is said to them Come the Apostle of Allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are big with pride
It is alike to them whether you beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them Allah will never forgive them surely Allah does not guide the transgressing people
They it is who say Do not spend upon those who are with the Apostle of Allah until they break up
And Allah s are the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
They say If we return to Medina the mighty will surely drive out the meaner therefrom and to Allah belongs the might and to His Apostle and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
O you who believe let not your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah and whoever does that these are the losers
And spend out of what We have given you before death comes to one of you so that he should say My Lord why didst Thou not respite me to a near term so that I should have given alms and been of the doers of good deeds
And Allah does not respite a soul when its appointed term has come and Allah is Aware of what you do
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth declares the glory of Allah to Him belongs the kingdom and to Him is due all praise and He has power over all things
He it is Who created you but one of you is an unbeliever and another of you is a believer and Allah sees what you do
He created the heavens and the earth with truth and He formed you then made goodly your forms and to Him is the ultimate resort
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth and He knows what you hide and what you manifest and Allah is Cognizant of what is in the hearts
Has there not come to you the story of those who disbelieved before then tasted the evil result of their conduct and they had a painful punishment
That is because there came to them their apostles with clear arguments but they said Shall mortals guide us
So they disbelieved and turned back and Allah does not stand in need of anything and Allah is Selfsufficient Praised
Those who disbelieve think that they shall never be raised Say Aye by my Lord you shall most certainly be raised then you shall most certainly be informed of what you did and that is easy to Allah
Therefore believe in Allah and His Apostle and the Light which We have revealed and Allah is Aware of what you do
On the day that He will gather you for the day of gathering that is the day of loss and gain and whoever believes in Allah and does good He will remove from him his evil and cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever that is the great achievement
And as for those who disbelieve and reject Our communications they are the inmates of the fire to abide therein and evil is the resort
No affliction comes about but by Allah s permission and whoever believes in Allah He guides aright his heart and Allah is Cognizant of all things
And obey Allah and obey the Apostle but if you turn back then upon Our Apostle devolves only the clear delivery of the message
Allah there is no god but He and upon Allah then let the believers rely
O you who believe surely from among your wives and your children there is an enemy to you therefore beware of them and if you pardon and forbear and forgive then surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Your possessions and your children are only a trial and Allah it is with Whom is a great reward
Therefore be careful of your duty to Allah as much as you can and hear and obey and spend it is better for your souls and whoever is saved from the greediness of his soul these it is that are the successful
If you set apart for Allah a goodly portion He will double it for you and forgive you and Allah is the Multiplier of rewards Forbearing
The Knower of the unseen and the seen the Mighty the Wise
O Prophet when you divorce women divorce them for their prescribed time and calculate the number of the days prescribed and be careful of your duty to Allah your Lord Do not drive them out of their houses nor should they themselves go forth unless they commit an open indecency and these are the limits of Allah and whoever goes beyond the limits of Allah he indeed does injustice to his own soul You do not know that Allah may after that bring about reunion
So when they have reached their prescribed time then retain them with kindness or separate them with kindness and call to witness two men of justice from among you and give upright testimony for Allah With that is admonished he who believes in Allah and the latter day and whoever is careful of his duty to Allah He will make for him an outlet
And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not and whoever trusts in Allah He is sufficient for him surely Allah attains His purpose Allah indeed has appointed a measure for everything
And as for those of your women who have despaired of menstruation if you have a doubt their prescribed time shall be three months and of those too who have not had their courses and as for the pregnant women their prescribed time is that they lay down their burden and whoever is careful of his duty to Allah He will make easy for him his affair
That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you and whoever is careful of his duty to Allah He will remove from him his evil and give him a big reward
Lodge them where you lodge according to your means and do not injure them in order that you may straiten them and if they are pregnant spend on them until they lay down their burden then if they suckle for you give them their recompense and enjoin one another among you to do good and if you disagree another woman shall suckle for him
Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance and whoever has his means of subsistence straitened to him let him spend out of that which Allah has given him Allah does not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent to which He has granted it Allah brings about ease after difficulty
And how many a town which rebelled against the commandment of its Lord and His apostles so We called it to account severely and We chastised it with a stern chastisement
So it tasted the evil result of its conduct and the end of its affair was perdition
Allah has prepared for them severe chastisement therefore be careful of your duty to Allah O men of understanding who believe
Allah has indeed revealed to you a reminder
An Apostle who recites to you the clear communications of Allah so that he may bring forth those who believe and do good deeds from darkness into light and whoever believes in Allah and does good deeds He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers now to abide therein forever Allah has indeed given him a goodly sustenance
Allah is He Who created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them the decree continues to descend among them that you may know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah indeed encompasses all things in His knowledge
O Prophet why do you forbid yourself that which Allah has made lawful for you you seek to please your wives and Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Allah indeed has sanctioned for you the expiation of your oaths and Allah is your Protector and He is the Knowing the Wise
And when the prophet secretly communicated a piece of information to one of his wives but when she informed others of it and Allah made him to know it he made known part of it and avoided part so when he informed her of it she said Who informed you of this
He said The Knowing the one Aware informed me
If you both turn to Allah then indeed your hearts are already inclined to this and if you back up each other against him then surely Allah it is Who is his Guardian and Jibreel and the believers that do good and the angels after that are the aiders
Maybe his Lord if he divorce you will give him in your place wives better than you submissive faithful obedient penitent adorers fasters widows and virgins
O you who believe save yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones over it are angels stern and strong they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them and do as they are commanded
O you who disbelieve do not urge excuses today you shall be rewarded only according to what you did
O you who believe turn to Allah a sincere turning maybe your Lord will remove from you your evil and cause you to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow on the day on which Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him their light shall run on before them and on their right hands they shall say Our Lord make perfect for us our light and grant us protection surely Thou hast power over all things
O Prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be hard against them and their abode is hell and evil is the resort
Allah sets forth an example to those who disbelieve the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut they were both under two of Our righteous servants but they acted treacherously towards them so they availed them naught against Allah and it was said Enter both the fire with those who enter
And Allah sets forth an example to those who believe the wife of Firon when she said My Lord build for me a house with Thee in the garden and deliver me from Firon and his doing and deliver me from the unjust people
And Marium the daughter of Imran who guarded her chastity so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and she accepted the truth of the words of her Lord and His books and she was of the obedient ones
Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom and He has power over all things
Who created death and life that He may try you which of you is best in deeds and He is the Mighty the Forgiving
Who created the seven heavens one above another you see no incongruity in the creation of the Beneficent Allah then look again can you see any disorder
Then turn back the eye again and again your look shall come back to you confused while it is fatigued
And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with lamps and We have made these missiles for the Shaitans and We have prepared for them the chastisement of burning
And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell and evil is the resort
When they shall be cast therein they shall hear a loud moaning of it as it heaves
Almost bursting for fury
Whenever a group is cast into it its keeper shall ask them Did there not come to you a warner
They shall say Yea indeed there came to us a warner but we rejected him and said Allah has not revealed anything you are only in a great error
And they shall say Had we but listened or pondered we should not have been among the inmates of the burning fire
So they shall acknowledge their sins but far will be forgiveness from the inmates of the burning fire
As for those who fear their Lord in secret they shall surely have forgiveness and a great reward
And conceal your word or manifest it surely He is Cognizant of what is in the hearts
Does He not know Who created
And He is the Knower of the subtleties the Aware
He it is Who made the earth smooth for you therefore go about in the spacious sides thereof and eat of His sustenance and to Him is the return after death
Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not make the earth to swallow you up Then lo it shall be in a state of commotion
Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not send down upon you a punishment
Then shall you know how was My warning
And certainly those before them rejected the truth then how was My disapproval
Have they not seen the birds above them expanding their wings and contracting them
What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent Allah
Surely He sees everything
Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you besides the Beneficent Allah
The unbelievers are only in deception
Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should withhold His sustenance Nay they persist in disdain and aversion
What is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a straight path
Say He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts little is it that you give thanks
Say He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered
And they say When shall this threat be executed if you are truthful
Say The knowledge thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain warner
But when they shall see it nigh the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry and it shall be said This is that which you used to call for
Say Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and those with me rather He will have mercy on us yet who will protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment
Say He is the Beneficent Allah we believe in Him and on Him do we rely so you shall come to know who it is that is in clear error
Say Have you considered if your water should go down who is it then that will bring you flowing water
Noon
I swear by the pen and what the angels write
By the grace of your Lord you are not mad
And most surely you shall have a reward never to be cut off
And most surely you conform yourself to sublime morality
So you shall see and they too shall see
Which of you is afflicted with madness
Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way and He best knows the followers of the right course
So do not yield to the rejecters
They wish that you should be pliant so they too would be pliant
And yield not to any mean swearer
Defamer going about with slander
Forbidder of good outstepping the limits sinful
Ignoble besides all that baseborn
Because he possesses wealth and sons
When Our communications are recited to him he says Stories of those of yore
We will brand him on the nose
Surely We will try them as We tried the owners of the garden when they swore that they would certainly cut off the produce in the morning
And were not willing to set aside a portion for the poor
Then there encompassed it a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping
So it became as black barren land
And they called out to each other in the morning
Saying Go early to your tilth if you would cut the produce
So they went while they consulted together secretly
Saying No poor man shall enter it today upon you
And in the morning they went having the power to prevent
But when they saw it they said Most surely we have gone astray
Nay we are made to suffer privation
The best of them said Did I not say to you Why do you not glorify Allah
They said Glory be to our Lord surely we were unjust
Then some of them advanced against others blaming each other
Said they O woe to us surely we were inordinate
Maybe our Lord will give us instead one better than it surely to our Lord do we make our humble petition
Such is the chastisement and certainly the chastisement of the hereafter is greater did they but know
Surely those who guard against evil shall have with their Lord gardens of bliss
What shall We then make that is treat those who submit as the guilty
What has happened to you
How do you judge
Or have you a book wherein you read
That you have surely therein what you choose
Or have you received from Us an agreement confirmed by an oath extending to the day of resurrection that you shall surely have what you demand
Ask them which of them will vouch for that
Or have they associates if they are truthful
On the day when there shall be a severe affliction and they shall be called upon to make obeisance but they shall not be able
Their looks cast down abasement shall overtake them and they were called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe
So leave Me and him who rejects this announcement We will overtake them by degrees from whence they perceive not
And I do bear with them surely My plan is firm
Or do you ask from them a reward so that they are burdened with debt
Or have they the knowledge of the unseen so that they write it down
So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord and be not like the companion of the fish when he cried while he was in distress
Were it not that favor from his Lord had overtaken him he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked Found while he was blamed
Then his Lord chose him and He made him of the good
And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the reminder and they say Most surely he is mad
And it is naught but a reminder to the nations
The sure calamity
What is the sure calamity
And what would make you realize what the sure calamity is
Samood and Ad called the striking calamity a lie
Then as to Samood they were destroyed by an excessively severe punishment
And as to Ad they were destroyed by a roaring violent blast
Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights and eight days unremittingly so that you might have seen the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of hollow palms
Do you then see of them one remaining
And Firon and those before him and the overthrown cities continuously committed sins
And they disobeyed the Apostle of their Lord so He punished them with a vehement punishment
Surely We bore you up in the ship when the water rose high
So that We may make it a reminder to you and that the retaining ear might retain it
And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast
And the earth and the mountains are borne away and crushed with a single crushing
On that day shall the great event come to pass
And the heaven shall cleave asunder so that on that day it shall be frail
And the angels shall be on the sides thereof and above them eight shall bear on that day your Lord s power
On that day you shall be exposed to view no secret of yours shall remain hidden
Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand he will say Lo read my book
Surely I knew that I shall meet my account
So he shall be in a life of pleasure
In a lofty garden
The fruits of which are near at hand
Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in the days gone by
And as for him who is given his book in his left hand he shall say O would that my book had never been given me
And I had not known what my account was
O would that it had made an end of me
My wealth has availed me nothing
My authority is gone away from me
Lay hold on him then put a chain on him
Then cast him into the burning fire
Then thrust him into a chain the length of which is seventy cubits
Surely he did not believe in Allah the Great
Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor
Therefore he has not here today a true friend
Nor any food except refuse
Which none but the wrongdoers eat
But nay I swear by that which you see
And that which you do not see
Most surely it is the Word brought by an honored Apostle
And it is not the word of a poet little is it that you believe
Nor the word of a soothsayer little is it that you mind
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings
We would certainly have seized him by the right hand
Then We would certainly have cut off his aorta
And not one of you could have withheld Us from him
And most surely it is a reminder for those who guard against evil
And most surely We know that some of you are rejecters
And most surely it is a great grief to the unbelievers
And most surely it is the true certainty
Thereforeglorify the name of your Lord the Great
One demanding demanded the chastisement which must befall
The unbelievers there is none to avert it
From Allah the Lord of the ways of Ascent
To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
Therefore endure with a goodly patience
Surely they think it to be far off
And We see it nigh
On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper
And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool
And friend shall not ask of friend
Though they shall be made to see each other
The guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement of that day by sacrificing his children
And his wife and his brother
And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter
And all those that are in the earth wishing then that this might deliver him
By no means
Surely it is a flaming fire
Dragging by the head
It shall claim him who turned and fled from truth
And amasses wealth then shuts it up
Surely man is created of a hasty temperament
Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him
And niggardly when good befalls him
Except those who pray
Those who are constant at their prayer
And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion
For him who begs and for him who is denied good
And those who accept the truth of the judgment day
And those who are fearful of the chastisement of their Lord
Surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing not to be felt secure of
And those who guard their private parts
Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess for these surely are not to be blamed
But he who seeks to go beyond this these it is that go beyond the limits
And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant
And those who are upright in their testimonies
And those who keep a guard on their prayer
Those shall be in gardens honored
But what is the matter with those who disbelieve that they hasten on around you
On the right hand and on the left in sundry parties
Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the garden of bliss
By no means Surely We have created them of what they know
But nay I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are certainly able
To bring instead others better than them and We shall not be overcome
Therefore leave them alone to go on with the false discourses and to sport until they come face to face with that day of theirs with which they are threatened
The day on which they shall come forth from their graves in haste as if they were hastening on to a goal
Their eyes cast down disgrace shall overtake them that is the day which they were threatened with
Surely We sent Nuh to his people saying Warn your people before there come upon them a painful chastisement
He said O my people
Surely I am a plain warner to you
That you should serve Allah and be careful of your duty to Him and obey me
He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay to an appointed term surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed did you but know
He said O my Lord surely I have called my people by night and by day
But my call has only made them flee the more
And whenever I have called them that Thou mayest forgive them they put their fingers in their ears cover themselves with their garments and persist and are puffed up with pride
Then surely I called to them aloud
Then surely I spoke to them in public and I spoke to them in secret
Then I said Ask forgiveness of your Lord surely He is the most Forgiving
He will send down upon you the cloud pouring down abundance of rain
And help you with wealth and sons and make for you gardens and make for you rivers
What is the matter with you that you fear not the greatness of Allah
And indeed He has created you through various grades
Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another
And made the moon therein a light and made the sun a lamp
And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a growth
Then He returns you to it then will He bring you forth a new bringing forth
And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse
That you may go along therein in wide paths
Nuh said My Lord surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children have added to him nothing but loss
And they have planned a very great plan
And they say By no means leave your gods nor leave Wadd nor Suwa nor Yaghus and Yauq and Nasr
And indeed they have led astray many and do not increase the unjust in aught but error
Because of their wrongs they were drowned then made to enter fire so they did not find any helpers besides Allah
And Nuh said My Lord leave not upon the land any dweller from among the unbelievers
For surely if Thou leave them they will lead astray Thy servants and will not beget any but immoral ungrateful children
My Lord forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house believing and the believing men and the believing women and do not increase the unjust in aught but destruction
Say It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn listened and they said Surely we have heard a wonderful Quran
Guiding to the right way so we believe in it and we will not set up any one with our Lord
And that He exalted be the majesty of our Lord has not taken a consort nor a son
And that the foolish amongst us used to forge extravagant things against Allah
And that we thought that men and jinn did not utter a lie against Allah
And that persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among jinn so they increased them in wrongdoing
And that they thought as you think that Allah would not raise anyone
And that we sought to reach heaven but we found it filled with strong guards and flaming stars
And that we used to sit in some of the sittingplaces thereof to steal a hearing but he who would try to listen now would find a flame lying in wait for him
And that we know not whether evil is meant for those who are on earth or whether their Lord means to bring them good
And that some of us are good and others of us are below that we are sects following different ways
And that we know that we cannot escape Allah in the earth nor can we escape Him by flight
And that when we heard the guidance we believed in it so whoever believes in his Lord he should neither fear loss nor being overtaken by disgrace
And that some of us are those who submit and some of us are the deviators so whoever submits these aim at the right way
And as to the deviators they are fuel of hell
And that if they should keep to the right way We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water
So that We might try them with respect to it and whoever turns aside from the reminder of his Lord He will make him enter into an afflicting chastisement
And that the mosques are Allah s therefore call not upon any one with Allah
And that when the servant of Allah stood up calling upon Him they wellnigh crowded him to death
Say I only call upon my Lord and I do not associate any one with Him
Say I do not control for you evil or good
Say Surely no one can protect me against Allah nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge
It is only a delivering of communications from Allah and His messages and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle surely he shall have the fire of hell to abide therein for a long time
Until when they see what they are threatened with then shall they know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number
Say I do not know whether that with which you are threatened be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a term
The Knower of the unseen so He does not reveal His secrets to any
Except to him whom He chooses as an apostle for surely He makes a guard to march before him and after him
So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord and He encompasses what is with them and He records the number of all things
O you who have wrapped up in your garments
Rise to pray in the night except a little
Half of it or lessen it a little
Or add to it and recite the Quran as it ought to be recited
Surely We will make to light upon you a weighty Word
Surely the rising by night is the firmest way to tread and the best corrective of speech
Surely you have in the day time a long occupation
And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with exclusive devotion
The Lord of the East and the West there is no god but He therefore take Him for a protector
And bear patiently what they say and avoid them with a becoming avoidance
And leave Me and the rejecters the possessors of ease and plenty and respite them a little
Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a flaming fire
And food that chokes and a painful punishment
On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains shall become as heaps of sand let loose
Surely We have sent to you an Apostle a witness against you as We sent an apostle to Firon
But Firon disobeyed the apostle so We laid on him a violent hold
How then will you guard yourselves if you disbelieve on the day which shall make children greyheaded
The heaven shall rend asunder thereby His promise is ever brought to fulfillment
Surely this is a reminder then let him who will take the way to his Lord
Surely your Lord knows that you pass in prayer nearly twothirds of the night and sometimes half of it and sometimes a third of it and also a party of those with you and Allah measures the night and the day He knows that you are not able to do it so He has turned to you mercifully therefore read what is easy of the Quran He knows that there must be among you sick and others who travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah and others who fight in Allah s way therefore read as much of it as is easy to you and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and offer to Allah a goodly gift and whatever of good you send on beforehand for yourselves you will find it with Allah that is best and greatest in reward and ask forgiveness of Allah surely Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O you who are clothed
Arise and warn
And your Lord do magnify
And your garments do purify
And uncleanness do shun
And bestow not favors that you may receive again with increase
And for the sake of your Lord be patient
For when the trumpet is sounded
That at that time shall be a difficult day
For the unbelievers anything but easy
Leave Me and him whom I created alone
And give him vast riches
And sons dwelling in his presence
And I adjusted affairs for him adjustably
And yet he desires that I should add more
By no means surely he offers opposition to Our communications
I will make a distressing punishment overtake him
Surely he reflected and guessed
But may he be cursed how he plotted
Again may he be cursed how he plotted
Then he looked
Then he frowned and scowled
Then he turned back and was big with pride
Then he said This is naught but enchantment narrated from others
This is naught but the word of a mortal
I will cast him into hell
And what will make you realize what hell is
It leaves naught nor does it spare aught
It scorches the mortal
Over it are nineteen
And We have not made the wardens of the fire others than angels and We have not made their number but as a trial for those who disbelieve that those who have been given the book may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith and those who have been given the book and the believers may not doubt and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the unbelievers may say What does Allah mean by this parable Thus does Allah make err whom He pleases and He guides whom He pleases and none knows the hosts of your Lord but He Himself and this is naught but a reminder to the mortals
Nay I swear by the moon
And the night when it departs
And the daybreak when it shines
Surely it hell is one of the gravest misfortunes
A warning to mortals
To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain behind
Every soul is held in pledge for what it earns
Except the people of the right hand
In gardens they shall ask each other
About the guilty
What has brought you into hell
They shall say We were not of those who prayed
And we used not to feed the poor
And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who entered into vain discourses
And we used to call the day of judgment a lie
Till death overtook us
So the intercession of intercessors shall not avail them
What is then the matter with them that they turn away from the admonition
As if they were asses taking fright
That had fled from a lion
Nay every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out
Nay but they do not fear the hereafter
Nay it is surely an admonition
So whoever pleases may mind it
And they will not mind unless Allah please
He is worthy to be feared and worthy to forgive
Nay I swear by the day of resurrection
Nay I swear by the selfaccusing soul
Does man think that We shall not gather his bones
Yea We are able to make complete his very fingertips
Nay man desires to give the lie to what is before him
He asks When is the day of resurrection
So when the sight becomes dazed
And the moon becomes dark
And the sun and the moon are brought together
Man shall say on that day Whither to fly to
By no means there shall be no place of refuge
With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest
Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and what he put off
Nay man is evidence against himself
Though he puts forth his excuses
Do not move your tongue with it to make haste with it
Surely on Us devolves the collecting of it and the reciting of it
Therefore when We have recited it follow its recitation
Again on Us devolves the explaining of it
Nay
But you love the present life
And neglect the hereafter
Some faces on that day shall be bright
Looking to their Lord
And other faces on that day shall be gloomy
Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity
Nay When it comes up to the throat
And it is said Who will be a magician
And he is sure that it is the hour of parting
And affliction is combined with affliction
To your Lord on that day shall be the driving
So he did not accept the truth nor did he pray
But called the truth a lie and turned back
Then he went to his followers walking away in haughtiness
Nearer to you is destruction and nearer
Again consider how nearer to you and nearer
Does man think that he is to be left to wander without an aim
Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements
Then he was a clot of blood so He created him then made him perfect
Then He made of him two kinds the male and the female
Is not He able to give life to the dead
There surely came over man a period of time when he was a thing not worth mentioning
Surely We have created man from a small lifegerm uniting itself We mean to try him so We have made him hearing seeing
Surely We have shown him the way he may be thankful or unthankful
Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and shackles and a burning fire
Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor
A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink they make it to flow a goodly flowing forth
They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall be spreading far and wide
And they give food out of love for Him to the poor and the orphan and the captive
We only feed you for Allah s sake we desire from you neither reward nor thanks
Surely we fear from our Lord a stern distressful day
Therefore Allah win guard them from the evil of that day and cause them to meet with ease and happiness
And reward them because they were patient with garden and silk
Reclining therein on raised couches they shall find therein neither the severe heat of the sun nor intense cold
And close down upon them shall be its shadows and its fruits shall be made near to them being easy to reach
And there shall be made to go round about them vessels of silver and goblets which are of glass
Transparent as glass made of silver they have measured them according to a measure
And they shall be made to drink therein a cup the admixture of which shall be ginger
Of a fountain therein which is named Salsabil
And round about them shall go youths never altering in age when you see them you will think them to be scattered pearls
And when you see there you shall see blessings and a great kingdom
Upon them shall be garments of fine green silk and thick silk interwoven with gold and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver and their Lord shall make them drink a pure drink
Surely this is a reward for you and your striving shall be recompensed
Surely We Ourselves have revealed the Quran to you revealing it in portions
Therefore wait patiently for the command of your Lord and obey not from among them a sinner or an ungrateful one
And glorify the name of your Lord morning and evening
And during part of the night adore Him and give glory to Him a long part of the night
Surely these love the transitory and neglect a grievous day before them
We created them and made firm their make and when We please We will bring in their place the likes of them by a change
Surely this is a reminder so whoever pleases takes to his Lord a way
And you do not please except that Allah please surely Allah is Knowing Wise
He makes whom He pleases to enter into His mercy and as for the unjust He has prepared for them a painful chastisement
I swear by the emissary winds sent one after another for men s benefit
By the raging hurricanes
Which scatter clouds to their destined places
Then separate them one from another
Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation
To clear or to warn
Most surely what you are threatened with must come to pass
So when the stars are made to lose their light
And when the heaven is rent asunder
And when the mountains are carried away as dust
And when the apostles are gathered at their appointed time
To what day is the doom fixed
To the day of decision
And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Did We not destroy the former generations
Then did We follow them up with later ones
Even thus shall We deal with the guilty
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Did We not create you from contemptible water
Then We placed it in a secure restingplace
Till an appointed term
So We proportion it how well are We at proportioning things
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Have We not made the earth to draw together to itself
The living and the dead
And made therein lofty mountains and given you to drink of sweet water
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Walk on to that which you called a lie
Walk on to the covering having three branches
Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame
Surely it sends up sparks like palaces
As if they were tawny camels
Woe on that day to the rejecters
This is the day on which they shall not speak
And permission shall not be given to them so that they should offer excuses
Woe on that day to the rejecters
This is the day of decision We have gathered you and those of yore
So if you have a plan plan against Me now
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Surely those who guard against evil shall be amid shades and fountains
And fruits such as they desire
Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did
Surely thus do We reward the doers of good
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little surely you are guilty
Woe on that day to the rejecters
And where it is said to them Bow down they do not bow down
Woe on that day to the rejecters
In what announcement then after it will they believe
Of what do they ask one another
About the great event
About which they differ
Nay they shall soon come to know
Nay Nay they shall soon know
Have We not made the earth an even expanse
And the mountains as projections thereon
And We created you in pairs
And We made your sleep to be rest to you
And We made the night to be a covering
And We made the day for seeking livelihood
And We made above you seven strong ones
And We made a shining lamp
And We send down from the clouds water pouring forth abundantly
That We may bring forth thereby corn and herbs
And gardens dense and luxuriant
Surely the day of decision is a day appointed
The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts
And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all openings
And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance
Surely hell lies in wait
A place of resort for the inordinate
Living therein for ages
They shall not taste therein cool nor drink
But boiling and intensely cold water
Requital corresponding
Surely they feared not the account
And called Our communications a lie giving the lie to the truth
And We have recorded everything in a book
So taste for We will not add to you aught but chastisement
Surely for those who guard against evil is achievement
Gardens and vineyards
And voluptuous women of equal age
And a pure cup
They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying
A reward from your Lord a gift according to a reckoning
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them the Beneficent Allah they shall not be able to address Him
The day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks they shall not speak except he whom the Beneficent Allah permits and who speaks the right thing
That is the sure day so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord
Surely We have warned you of a chastisement near at hand the day when man shall see what his two hands have sent before and the unbeliever shall say O would that I were dust
I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of the wicked
And by those who gently draw out the souls of the blessed
And by those who float in space
Then those who are foremost going ahead
Then those who regulate the affair
The day on which the quaking one shall quake
What must happen afterwards shall follow it
Hearts on that day shall palpitate
Their eyes cast down
They say Shall we indeed be restored to our first state
What when we are rotten bones
They said That then would be a return occasioning loss
But it shall be only a single cry
When lo they shall be wakeful
Has not there come to you the story of Musa
When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley twice
Go to Firon surely he has become inordinate
Then say Have you a desire to purify yourself
And I will guide you to your Lord so that you should fear
So he showed him the mighty sign
But he rejected the truth and disobeyed
Then he went back hastily
Then he gathered men and called out
Then he said I am your lord the most high
So Allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the former life
Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears
Are you the harder to create or the heaven He made it
He raised high its height then put it into a right good state
And He made dark its night and brought out its light
And the earth He expanded it after that
He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage
And the mountains He made them firm
A provision for you and for your cattle
But when the great predominating calamity comes
The day on which man shall recollect what he strove after
And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees
Then as for him who is inordinate
And prefers the life of this world
Then surely the hell that is the abode
And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his Lord and forbids the soul from low desires
Then surely the garden that is the abode
They ask you about the hour when it will come
About what You are one to remind of it
To your Lord is the goal of it
You are only a warner to him who would fear it
On the day that they see it it will be as though they had not tarried but the latter part of a day or the early part of it
He frowned and turned his back
Because there came to him the blind man
And what would make you know that he would purify himself
Or become reminded so that the reminder should profit him
As for him who considers himself free from need of you
To him do you address yourself
And no blame is on you if he would not purify himself
And as to him who comes to you striving hard
And he fears
From him will you divert yourself
Nay surely it is an admonishment
So let him who pleases mind it
In honored books
Exalted purified
In the hands of scribes
Noble virtuous
Cursed be man how ungrateful is he
Of what thing did He create him
Of a small seed He created him then He made him according to a measure
Then as for the way He has made it easy for him
Then He causes him to die then assigns to him a grave
Then when He pleases He will raise him to life again
Nay but he has not done what He bade him
Then let man look to his food
That We pour down the water pouring it down in abundance
Then We cleave the earth cleaving it asunder
Then We cause to grow therein the grain
And grapes and clover
And the olive and the palm
And thick gardens
And fruits and herbage
A provision for you and for your cattle
But when the deafening cry comes
The day on which a man shall fly from his brother
And his mother and his father
And his spouse and his son
Every man of them shall on that day have an affair which will occupy him
Many faces on that day shall be bright
Laughing joyous
And many faces on that day on them shall be dust
Darkness shall cover them
These are they who are unbelievers the wicked
When the sun is covered
And when the stars darken
And when the mountains are made to pass away
And when the camels are left untended
And when the wild animals are made to go forth
And when the seas are set on fire
And when souls are united
And when the female infant buried alive is asked
For what sin she was killed
And when the books are spread
And when the heaven has its covering removed
And when the hell is kindled up
And when the garden is brought nigh
Every soul shall then know what it has prepared
But nay I swear by the stars
That run their course and hide themselves
And the night when it departs
And the morning when it brightens
Most surely it is the Word of an honored messenger
The processor of strength having an honorable place with the Lord of the Dominion
One to be obeyed and faithful in trust
And your companion is not gone mad
And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon
Nor of the unseen is he a tenacious concealer
Nor is it the word of the cursed Shaitan
Whither then will you go
It is naught but a reminder for the nations
For him among you who pleases to go straight
And you do not please except that Allah please the Lord of the worlds
When the heaven becomes cleft asunder
And when the stars become dispersed
And when the seas are made to flow forth
And when the graves are laid open
Every soul shall know what it has sent before and held back
O man what has beguiled you from your Lord the Gracious one
Who created you then made you complete then made you symmetrical
Into whatever form He pleased He constituted you
Nay but you give the lie to the judgment day
And most surely there are keepers over you
Honorable recorders
They know what you do
Most surely the righteous are in bliss
And most surely the wicked are in burning fire
They shall enter it on the day of judgment
And they shall by no means be absent from it
And what will make you realize what the day of judgment is
Again what will make you realize what the day of judgment is
The day on which no soul shall control anything for another soul and the command on that day shall be entirely Allah s
Woe to the defrauders
Who when they take the measure of their dues from men take it fully
But when they measure out to others or weigh out for them they are deficient
Do not these think that they shall be raised again
For a mighty day
The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
Nay most surely the record of the wicked is in the Sijjin
And what will make you know what the Sijjin is
It is a written book
Woe on that day to the rejecters
Who give the lie to the day of judgment
And none gives the lie to it but every exceeder of limits sinful one
When Our communications are recited to him he says Stories of those of yore
Nay rather what they used to do has become like rust upon their hearts
Nay most surely they shall on that day be debarred from their Lord
Then most surely they shall enter the burning fire
Then shall it be said This is what you gave the lie to
Nay
Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in the Iliyin
And what will make you know what the highest Iliyin is
It is a written book
Those who are drawn near to Allah shall witness it
Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss
On thrones they shall gaze
You will recognize in their faces the brightness of bliss
They are made to quaff of a pure drink that is sealed to others
The sealing of it is with musk and for that let the aspirers aspire
And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim
A fountain from which drink they who are drawn near to Allah
Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe
And when they passed by them they winked at one another
And when they returned to their own followers they returned exulting
And when they saw them they said Most surely these are in error
And they were not sent to be keepers over them
So today those who believe shall laugh at the unbelievers
On thrones they will look
Surely the disbelievers are rewarded as they did
When the heaven bursts asunder
And obeys its Lord and it must
And when the earth is stretched
And casts forth what is in it and becomes empty
And obeys its Lord and it must
O man surely you must strive to attain to your Lord a hard striving until you meet Him
Then as to him who is given his book in his right hand
He shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning
And he shall go back to his people joyful
And as to him who is given his book behind his back
He shall call for perdition
And enter into burning fire
Surely he was erstwhile joyful among his followers
Surely he thought that he would never return
Yea surely his Lord does ever see him
But nay I swear by the sunset redness
And the night and that which it drives on
And the moon when it grows full
That you shall most certainly enter one state after another
But what is the matter with them that they do not believe
And when the Quran is recited to them they do not make obeisance
Nay those who disbelieve give the lie to the truth
And Allah knows best what they hide
So announce to them a painful punishment
Except those who believe and do good for them is a reward that shall never be cut off
I swear by the mansions of the stars
And the promised day
And the bearer of witness and those against whom the witness is borne
Cursed be the makers of the pit
Of the fire kept burning with fuel
When they sat by it
And they were witnesses of what they did with the believers
And they did not take vengeance on them for aught except that they believed in Allah the Mighty the Praised
Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and Allah is a Witness of all things
Surely as for those who persecute the believing men and the believing women then do not repent they shall have the chastisement of hell and they shall have the chastisement of burning
Surely as for those who believe and do good they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow that is the great achievement
Surely the might of your Lord is great
Surely He it is Who originates and reproduces
And He is the Forgiving the Loving
Lord of the Arsh the Glorious
The great doer of what He will
Has not there come to you the story of the hosts
Of Firon and Samood
Nay those who disbelieve are in the act of giving the lie to the truth
And Allah encompasses them on every side
Nay it is a glorious Quran
In a guarded tablet
I swear by the heaven and the comer by night
And what will make you know what the comer by night is
The star of piercing brightness
There is not a soul but over it is a keeper
So let man consider of what he is created
He is created of water pouring forth
Coming from between the back and the ribs
Most surely He is able to return him to life
On the day when hidden things shall be made manifest
He shall have neither strength nor helper
I swear by the raingiving heavens
And the earth splitting with plants
Most surely it is a decisive word
And it is no joke
Surely they will make a scheme
And I too will make a scheme
So grant the unbelievers a respite let them alone for a while
Glorify the name of your Lord the Most High
Who creates then makes complete
And Who makes things according to a measure then guides them to their goal
And Who brings forth herbage
Then makes it dried up dustcolored
We will make you recite so you shall not forget
Except what Allah pleases surely He knows the manifest and what is hidden
And We will make your way smooth to a state of ease
Therefore do remind surely reminding does profit
He who fears will mind
And the most unfortunate one will avoid it
Who shall enter the great fire
Then therein he shall neither live nor die
He indeed shall be successful who purifies himself
And magnifies the name of his Lord and prays
Nay you prefer the life of this world
While the hereafter is better and more lasting
Most surely this is in the earlier scriptures
The scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa
Has not there come to you the news of the overwhelming calamity
Some faces on that day shall be downcast
Laboring toiling
Entering into burning fire
Made to drink from a boiling spring
They shall have no food but of thorns
Which will neither fatten nor avail against hunger
Other faces on that day shall be happy
Wellpleased because of their striving
In a lofty garden
Wherein you shall not hear vain talk
Therein is a fountain flowing
Therein are thrones raised high
And drinkingcups ready placed
And cushions set in a row
And carpets spread out
Will they not then consider the camels how they are created
And the heaven how it is reared aloft
And the mountains how they are firmly fixed
And the earth how it is made a vast expanse
Therefore do remind for you are only a reminder
You are not a watcher over them
But whoever turns back and disbelieves
Allah will chastise him with the greatest chastisement
Surely to Us is their turning back
Then surely upon Us is the taking of their account
I swear by the daybreak
And the ten nights
And the even and the odd
And the night when it departs
Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess understanding
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Ad
The people of Aram possessors of lofty buildings
The like of which were not created in the other cities
And with Samood who hewed out the rocks in the valley
And with Firon the lord of hosts
Who committed inordinacy in the cities
So they made great mischief therein
Therefore your Lord let down upon them a portion of the chastisement
Most surely your Lord is watching
And as for man when his Lord tries him then treats him with honor and makes him lead an easy life he says My Lord honors me
But when He tries him differently then straitens to him his means of subsistence he says My Lord has disgraced me
Nay but you do not honor the orphan
Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor
And you eat away the heritage devouring everything indiscriminately
And you love wealth with exceeding love
Nay when the earth is made to crumble to pieces
And your Lord comes and also the angels in ranks
And hell is made to appear on that day On that day shall man be mindful and what shall being mindful then avail him
He shall say O would that I had sent before for this my life
But on that day shall no one chastise with anything like His chastisement
And no one shall bind with anything like His binding
O soul that art at rest
Return to your Lord wellpleased with him wellpleasing Him
So enter among My servants
And enter into My garden
Nay I swear by this city
And you shall be made free from obligation in this city
And the begetter and whom he begot
Certainly We have created man to be in distress
Does he think that no one has power over him
He shall say I have wasted much wealth
Does he think that no one sees him
Have We not given him two eyes
And a tongue and two lips
And pointed out to him the two conspicuous ways
But he would not attempt the uphill road
And what will make you comprehend what the uphill road is
It is the setting free of a slave
Or the giving of food in a day of hunger
To an orphan having relationship
Or to the poor man lying in the dust
Then he is of those who believe and charge one another to show patience and charge one another to show compassion
These are the people of the right hand
And as for those who disbelieve in our communications they are the people of the left hand
On them is fire closed over
I swear by the sun and its brilliance
And the moon when it follows the sun
And the day when it shows it
And the night when it draws a veil over it
And the heaven and Him Who made it
And the earth and Him Who extended it
And the soul and Him Who made it perfect
Then He inspired it to understand what is right and wrong for it
He will indeed be successful who purifies it
And he will indeed fail who corrupts it
Samood gave the lie to the truth in their inordinacy
When the most unfortunate of them broke forth with
So Allah s apostle said to them Leave alone Allah s shecamel and give her to drink
But they called him a liar and slaughtered her therefore their Lord crushed them for their sin and levelled them with the ground
And He fears not its consequence
I swear by the night when it draws a veil
And the day when it shines in brightness
And the creating of the male and the female
Your striving is most surely directed to various ends
Then as for him who gives away and guards against evil
And accepts the best
We will facilitate for him the easy end
And as for him who is niggardly and considers himself free from need of Allah
And rejects the best
We will facilitate for him the difficult end
And his wealth will not avail him when he perishes
Surely Ours is it to show the way
And most surely Ours is the hereafter and the former
Therefore I warn you of the fire that flames
None shall enter it but the most unhappy
Who gives the lie to the truth and turns his back
And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most against evil
Who gives away his wealth purifying himself
And no one has with him any boon for which he should be rewarded
Except the seeking of the pleasure of his Lord the Most High
And he shall soon be wellpleased
I swear by the early hours of the day
And the night when it covers with darkness
Your Lord has not forsaken you nor has He become displeased
And surely what comes after is better for you than that which has gone before
And soon will your Lord give you so that you shall be well pleased
Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter
And find you lost that is unrecognized by men and guide them to you
And find you in want and make you to be free from want
Therefore as for the orphan do not oppress him
And as for him who asks do not chide him
And as for the favor of your Lord do announce it
Have We not expanded for you your breast
And taken off from you your burden
Which pressed heavily upon your back
And exalted for you your esteem
Surely with difficulty is ease
With difficulty is surely ease
So when you are free nominate
And make your Lord your exclusive object
I swear by the fig and the olive
And mount Sinai
And this city made secure
Certainly We created man in the best make
Then We render him the lowest of the low
Except those who believe and do good so they shall have a reward never to be cut off
Then who can give you the lie after this about the judgment
Is not Allah the best of the Judges
Read in the name of your Lord Who created
He created man from a clot
Read and your Lord is Most Honorable
Who taught to write with the pen
Taught man what he knew not
Nay man is most surely inordinate
Because he sees himself free from want
Surely to your Lord is the return
Have you seen him who forbids
A servant when he prays
Have you considered if he were on the right way
Or enjoined guarding against evil
Have you considered if he gives the lie to the truth and turns his back
Does he not know that Allah does see
Nay if he desist not We would certainly smite his forehead
A lying sinful forehead
Then let him summon his council
We too would summon the braves of the army
Nay obey him not and make obeisance and draw nigh to Allah
Surely We revealed it on the grand night
And what will make you comprehend what the grand night
The grand night is better than a thousand months
The angels and Jibreel descend in it by the permission of their Lord for every affair
Peace it is till the break of the morning
Those who disbelieved from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists could not have separated from the faithful until there had come to them the clear evidence
An apostle from Allah reciting pure pages
Wherein are all the right ordinances
And those who were given the Book did not become divided except after clear evidence had come to them
And they were not enjoined anything except that they should serve Allah being sincere to Him in obedience upright and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate and that is the right religion
Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book and the polytheists shall be in the fire of hell abiding therein they are the worst of men
As for those who believe and do good surely they are the best of men
Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow abiding therein for ever Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him that is for him who fears his Lord
When the earth is shaken with her violent shaking
And the earth brings forth her burdens
And man says What has befallen her
On that day she shall tell her news
Because your Lord had inspired her
On that day men shall come forth in sundry bodies that they may be shown their works
So he who has done an atom s weight of good shall see it
And he who has done an atom s weight of evil shall see it
I swear by the runners breathing pantingly
Then those that produce fire striking
Then those that make raids at morn
Then thereby raise dust
Then rush thereby upon an assembly
Most surely man is ungrateful to his Lord
And most surely he is a witness of that
And most surely he is tenacious in the love of wealth
Does he not then know when what is in the graves is raised
And what is in the breasts is made apparent
Most surely their Lord that day shall be fully aware of them
The terrible calamity
What is the terrible calamity
And what will make you comprehend what the terrible calamity is
The day on which men shall be as scattered moths
And the mountains shall be as loosened wool
Then as for him whose measure of good deeds is heavy
He shall live a pleasant life
And as for him whose measure of good deeds is light
His abode shall be the abyss
And what will make you know what it is
A burning fire
Abundance diverts you
Until you come to the graves
Nay you shall soon know
Nay
Nay you shall soon know
Nay if you had known with a certain knowledge
You should most certainly have seen the hell
Then you shall most certainly see it with the eye of certainty
Then on that day you shall most certainly be questioned about the boons
I swear by the time
Most surely man is in loss
Except those who believe and do good and enjoin on each other truth and enjoin on each other patience
Woe to every slanderer defamer
Who amasses wealth and considers it a provision against mishap
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
Nay he shall most certainly be hurled into the crushing disaster
And what will make you realize what the crushing disaster is
It is the fire kindled by Allah
Which rises above the hearts
Surely it shall be closed over upon them
In extended columns
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the possessors of the elephant
Did He not cause their war to end in confusion
And send down to prey upon them birds in flocks
Casting against them stones of baked clay
So He rendered them like straw eaten up
For the protection of the Qureaish
Their protection during their trading caravans in the winter and the summer
So let them serve the Lord of this House
Who feeds them against hunger and gives them security against fear
Have you considered him who calls the judgment a lie
That is the one who treats the orphan with harshness
And does not urge others to feed the poor
So woe to the praying ones
Who are unmindful of their prayers
Who do good to be seen
And withhold the necessaries of life
Surely We have given you Kausar
Therefore pray to your Lord and make a sacrifice
Surely your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity
Say O unbelievers
I do not serve that which you serve
Nor do you serve Him Whom I serve
Nor am I going to serve that which you serve
Nor are you going to serve Him Whom I serve
You shall have your religion and I shall have my religion
When there comes the help of Allah and the victory
And you see men entering the religion of Allah in companies
Then celebrate the praise of your Lord and ask His forgiveness surely He is oftreturning to mercy
Perdition overtake both hands of Abu Lahab and he will perish
His wealth and what he earns will not avail him
He shall soon burn in fire that flames
And his wife the bearer of fuel
Upon her neck a halter of strongly twisted rope
Say He Allah is One
Allah is He on Whom all depend
He begets not nor is He begotten
And none is like Him
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of the dawn
From the evil of what He has created
And from the evil of the utterly dark night when it comes
And from the evil of those who blow on knots
And from the evil of the envious when he envies
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of men
The King of men
The god of men
From the evil of the whisperings of the slinking Shaitan
Who whispers into the hearts of men
From among the jinn and the men
All praise is due to God the Lord of the Universe
the Beneficent the Merciful
Lord of the Day of Judgement
You alone we worship and to You alone we turn for help
Guide us to the straight path
the path of those You have blessed not of those who have incurred Your wrath nor of those who have gone astray
Alif Lam Mim
This is the Book there is no doubt in it It is a guide for those who are mindful of God
who believe in the unseen and are steadfast in prayer and spend out of what We have provided them with
those who believe in the revelation sent down to you and in what was sent before you and firmly believe in the life to come
they are the people who are rightly following their Lord and it is they who shall be successful
As for those who are bent on denying the truth it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or not they will not believe
God has sealed their hearts and their ears and over their eyes there is a covering
They will have a terrible punishment
There are some who say We believe in God and the Last Day yet they are not believers
They seek to deceive God and the believers but they only deceive themselves though they do not realize it
In their hearts is a disease which God has increased
They will have a painful punishment because they have been lying
When they are told Do not cause corruption in the land they say We are only promoters of peace
but it is they who are really causing corruption though they do not realize it
And when they are told Believe as other people have believed they say Are we to believe just as fools believe
Surely they are the fools even though they do not realize it
When they meet those who believe they say We believe
But when they are alone with their evil leaders they say We are really with you we were only mocking
God will requite them for their mockery and draw them on for a while to wander blindly in their insolence
Such are those who have taken misguidance in exchange for guidance but their bargain does not profit them nor have they found true guidance
They are like those who kindled a fire and when it lighted up all around them God took away their sight and left them in utter darkness unable to see
deaf dumb and blind they will never return to the right path
Or their case is like that of heavy rain pouring down from the clouds accompanied by darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears at the sound of thunderclaps for fear of death
God thus encompasses those who deny the truth
The lightning almost takes away their sight whenever it flashes upon them they walk on but as soon as darkness falls around them they stand still
Indeed if God pleased He could take away their hearing and their sight God has power over all things
People worship your Lord who created you and those before you so that you may become righteous
who made the earth a bed and the sky a canopy and it is He who sends down rain from above for the growth of every kind of food for your sustenance
And do not knowingly set up rivals to God
If you are in doubt about the revelation We have sent down to Our servant then produce a single chapter like it and call upon your helpers besides God if you are truthful
But if you cannot do it and you can never do it then guard yourselves against the Fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for those who deny the truth
Give the good news to those who believe and do good works that they will have Gardens through which rivers flow whenever they are given fruit to eat they will say This is what we were provided with before because they were given similar things And there will be pure spouses for them and they will abide there forever
God does not disdain to give a parable about a gnat or a smaller creature
The faithful know that it is the truth from their Lord but those who deny the truth ask What could God mean by this parable
He lets many go astray through it and guides many by it
But He makes only the disobedient go astray
those who break God s covenant after they have pledged to keep it and sever whatever God has ordered to be joined and spread corruption in the land it is they who are the losers
How can you disbelieve in God when you were dead lifeless and He gave you life
He will let you die once more then bring you back to life again whereupon you will be returned to Him
It is He who created everything on the earth for you then He turned towards heaven and fashioned it into the seven heavens
He has knowledge of all things
When your Lord said to the angels I am putting a successor on earth they said Will You place someone there who will cause corruption on it and shed blood while we glorify You with Your praise and extol Your holiness
God answered Surely I know that which you do not know
He taught Adam all the names then He set them before the angels and said Tell Me the names of these if what you say be true
They said Glory be to You we have no knowledge except whatever You have taught us
You are the All Knowing the All Wise
Then He said O Adam tell them their names
When Adam had told them the names God said to the angels Did I not say to you I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth and I know what you reveal and what you conceal
When We said to the angels Bow down before Adam they all bowed except for Iblis Satan
He refused and acted proudly and became an unbeliever
We said O Adam live with your wife in Paradise and eat freely from it anywhere you may wish
Yet do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers
But Satan caused them both to slip through this and thus brought about the loss of their former state
We said Go down from here as enemies to each other and on earth you shall have your abode and your livelihood for a while
Then Adam received some words of prayer from his Lord and He accepted his repentance
He is the Forgiving One the Merciful
We said Go down all of you from here then when guidance comes to you from Me anyone who follows My guidance will have no fear nor will they grieve
those who deny and reject Our signs shall be the inhabitants of the Fire therein shall they abide forever
Children of Israel remember the favours I have bestowed upon you and fulfil the covenant that you made with Me I shall fulfil the covenant I made with you
Fear Me alone
And believe in the message I have sent down which fulfils that predictions about the last prophet in their Scripture which you already possess and do not be foremost among those who deny its truth
Do not sell My revelations for a paltry price fear Me alone
Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth when you know it
Attend to your prayers give the zakat prescribed alms and bow down with those who bow down
Do you admonish others to do good and forget this yourselves
Yet you read the Book
Will you not then understand
Seek help with patience and prayer this is indeed an exacting discipline but not to the humble
who know for certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him
Children of Israel remember My blessing which I have bestowed on you and how I favoured you above all other people
Guard yourselves against the Day on which no soul shall in the least avail another when neither intercession nor ransom shall be accepted from it nor shall help be given to it
Remember when We delivered you from Pharaoh s people who subjected you to grievous torment slaying your sons and sparing only your daughters surely in that there was a great trial for you from your Lord
and when We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh s people while you looked on
We appointed for Moses forty nights on Mount Sinai and in his absence you took to worshipping the calf and thus became transgressors
Yet after that We pardoned you so that you might be grateful
Remember when We gave Moses the Scripture and the criterion to distinguish between right and wrong so that you might be guided
When Moses said to his people O my people you have indeed wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf turn in repentance to your Creator and slay the culprits among you
That course is best for you in the sight of your Maker He relented towards you
He is the Forgiving One the Merciful
Remember when you said Moses we will not believe in you until we see God with our own eyes a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on
Then We brought you back to life after your death so that you might be grateful
Then We caused the clouds to provide shade for you and sent down for you manna and quails saying Eat the good things We have provided for you
Indeed they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves
Remember when We said Enter this land and eat freely wherever you will Make your way through the gates bowing down and saying God
Forgive us our sins We shall forgive you your sins and We shall give abundance to those who do good
But the wrongdoers changed the words to something other than what they had been told So We sent down upon the transgressors a punishment from heaven because they were disobedient
When Moses prayed for water for his people We said to him Strike the rock with your staff
And there gushed out from it twelve springs Each tribe knew its drinkingplace
We said Eat and drink what God has provided and do not act wrongfully in the land spreading corruption
When you said Moses we cannot bear to eat only one kind of food so pray to your Lord to bring forth for us some of the earth s produce its herbs and cucumbers its garlic lentils and onions
Moses said Would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is better
Go to some town and there you will find all that you demand
Abasement and destitution were stamped upon them and they incurred the wrath of God for having rejected His signs and they killed His prophets unjustly because they were rebels and transgressors
The believers the Jews the Christians and the Sabaeans all those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good deeds will be rewarded by their Lord they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Children of Israel We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain high above you saying Hold fast to what We have given you and bear its contents in mind so that you may guard yourselves against evil
Yet after that you turned away and but for God s grace and mercy you would have surely been among the losers
You are aware of those who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath whereupon We said to them Be as apes despised
We made their fate an example to their own generation and to those who followed them and a lesson to those who fear God
When Moses said to his people God commands you to sacrifice a heifer they said Are you making a mockery of us
He answered God forbid that I should be so ignorant
They said Ask your Lord to make it clear to us what sort of heifer she should be
He answered God says she should be neither too old nor too young but in between so do as you are commanded
They said Call on your Lord for us to show us what colour she should be
He answered God says she should be a bright yellow heifer pleasing to the eye
They said Ask your Lord to make it clear to us the exact type of heifer she should be for to us all heifers look alike
If God wills we shall be rightly guided
Moses answered Your Lord says she should be a heifer which has not been yoked to plough the land or water the fields a heifer free from any blemish
Now you have told us the truth they answered and they sacrificed it though they would rather not have done it
Then when you Israelites killed someone and started to blame one another God brought to light what you concealed
We said Strike the corpse with a part of it
Thus God restores the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand
Then your hearts became as hard as rock or even harder for there are rocks from which streams gush forth and there are some that cleave asunder and water flows out from them while others fall down for fear of God
God is not unaware of what you do
Do you then hope that they will believe in you when some of them have already heard the word of God and then after having understood it they knowingly perverted it
When they meet the faithful they say We are believers
But when alone they say to each other Must you tell them what God has revealed to us They will only use it to argue against you before your Lord
Have you no sense
Do they not know that God knows all that they conceal and all that they disclose
There are among them unlettered people who have no real knowledge of the Scriptures knowing only their own wishful thinking and following only conjecture
Woe to those who write the scripture with their own hands and then declare This is from God in order to sell it for a paltry price
Woe to them because of what their own hands have written and woe to them for what they have earned
They say The Fire is not going to touch us and even if it does it will only be for a few days Say to them Have you received a promise from God for God never breaks His promise or do you attribute something to God which you do not know
Truly those who do evil and are encompassed by their misdeeds shall be the inmates of the Fire Therein they shall abide forever
but those who believe and do good works are the heirs of Paradise there they shall abide forever
Remember when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel Worship none but God and be good to your parents and to relatives and orphans and the needy And speak kindly to people
Attend to your prayers and pay the zakat prescribed alms But with the exception of a few you turned away in aversion and paid no heed
When We made a covenant with you We said You shall not shed each other s blood nor turn your people out of their homes
You consented to this and bore witness
Yet here you are slaying one another and driving some of your own people from their homelands aiding one another against them committing sin and aggression but if they came to you as captives you would ransom them
Surely their very expulsion was unlawful for you
Do you believe in one part of the Book and deny another part of it
Those of you who act thus shall be rewarded with disgrace in this world and with a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection
God is never unaware of what you do
Such are they who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter
Their punishment shall not be lightened for them nor shall they be helped
To Moses We gave the Book and sent a succession of messengers after him
We gave Jesus son of Mary clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit
But whenever a messenger came to you with something which you did not desire you grew arrogant calling some liars and slaying others
They say Our hearts are impenetrably wrapped against whatever you say but God has rejected them for their denial they have but little faith
And now that a Book has come to them from God fulfilling that predictions about the final prophet in their scriptures which is with them they deny it whereas previously they used to pray for victory against the disbelievers yet when there came to them that which they recognized as the truth they rejected it
God s rejection is the due of all who deny the truth
What they have sold their souls for is evil to the denial of God s own revelation grudging that He should reveal His bounty to whom He chooses from among His servants
They have incurred wrath upon wrath
Humiliating punishment awaits those who deny the truth
When they are told Believe in what God has revealed they say We believe in what was revealed to us while they deny the truth in what has been sent down after that even though it is the Truth confirming that which they already have
Say Why did you kill God s prophets in the past if you were true believers
Moses came to you with clear signs but in his absence you worshipped the calf and became wrongdoers
When We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you saying Hold firmly to what We have given you and listen you said We hear but we disobey and their hearts were filled with the love of the calf because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth Say Evil is that to which your faith enjoins you if you are indeed believers
Say If God s abode of the Hereafter is for you alone to the exclusion of all others then wish for death if you are truthful
But they will never wish for death because of what their own hands have sent on before them God is fully aware of the wrongdoers
You will find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people even the polytheists
Any of them would wish to be given a life of a thousand years though even such a long life would not save them from Our punishment and God sees all that they do
Say Anyone who is an enemy of Gabriel who by God s leave has brought down to your heart the Quran fulfilling that predictions about the last prophet in the earlier revelations which precedes it and is a guidance and good news for the faithful
whoever is an enemy of God His angels or His messengers or of Gabriel or Michael will surely find that God too is the enemy of those who deny the truth
We have sent down clear signs to you and no one will reject them except the wicked
Why is it that whenever they make a covenant some of them cast it aside
Most of them do not believe
Whenever a messenger from God has come to them fulfilling that predictions which they already had some of those to whom the Book was given have cast off the Book of God behind their backs as if they had no knowledge
They pursued what the devils falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon
Solomon was not an unbeliever it is the devils who are unbelievers
They taught people witchcraft and that which was sent down to Harut and Marut the two angels in Babylon
But these two taught no one until they had said We are but a trial therefore do not disbelieve in God s guidance
So men learnt from them that by which they caused discord between man and wife but they harmed no one thereby except by the command of God on the contrary these people learned that which would harm them and do them no good knowing full well that whoever acquired this knowledge would have no share in the Hereafter
Evil indeed was the price for which they sold their souls if only they had known it
And had they but believed and been mindful of God His reward would have been far better for them if they had but known it
Believers do not say to the Prophet Ra ina but say Unzurna and listen to him with attention For those who deny the truth there is a painful punishment
They who deny the truth from among the People of the Book or from among those who associate partners with God do not desire that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord
But God singles out for His grace whom He wills for God is limitless in His great bounty
If We abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten We will replace it by a better one or one similar to it
Do you not know that God has power over all things
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God alone And that there is no protector or helper for you besides God
Do you all want to question your messenger just as Moses was questioned previously
Anyone who exchanges faith for unbelief has strayed from the right path
Many among the People of the Book wish through envy to lead you back to unbelief now that you have embraced the faith and the truth has been made plain to them
But you should pardon them and bear with them until God gives His command
Truly God has power over all things
Attend to your prayers and pay the prescribed alms any good you store up for yourselves you will find it with God
Certainly God sees what you do
They declare None shall ever enter Heaven unless he be a Jew or a Christian
This is their own wishful thinking
Prophet say Produce your evidence if you are telling the truth
Indeed those who submit themselves to God and act righteously shall be rewarded by their Lord they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
The Jews say The Christians have no ground to stand on and the Christians say The Jews have no ground to stand on Yet they both recite the Book and those who have no knowledge say the same God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning their disputes
Who could be more wicked than someone who prevents God s name from being mentioned in His places of worship and seeks to bring about their ruin while it behoves these men to enter them with fear in their hearts
There is disgrace in store for them in this world and a great punishment in the next
The East and the West belong to God Whichever way you turn there is the Face of God
God is all pervading and all knowing
They say God has taken a son
Glory be to Him
Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him all things are obedient to Him
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and when He decrees something He says only Be and it is
Those who are devoid of knowledge say Why does God not speak to us or show us a sign
The same demand was made by those before them their hearts are all alike
We have made the signs clear to those whose faith is firm
We have sent you with the truth bearing good news and giving warning
You will not be held accountable for the people of the Fire
Neither the Christians nor the Jews will be pleased with you until you follow their ways
Say God s guidance is the only true guidance
If you followed their desires after the knowledge which has come to you you would not have any patron or supporter against God
Those whom We have given this Book follow it as it ought to be followed it is they who truly believe in it those who deny it will be the losers
Children of Israel remember My favour which I have bestowed upon you and how I preferred you above all other people
and fear a Day when no human being shall avail another Nor shall ransom be accepted from any of them nor shall intercession be of any use to them and none shall be succoured
When his Lord tested Abraham with certain commands and he fulfilled them He said I will make you a leader of men
Abraham asked And what of my descendants
He answered My covenant does not extend to the transgressors
And We made the House the Ka bah a place of assembly and a sanctuary for mankind saying Make the place where Abraham stood a place of worship We commanded Abraham and Ishmael Purify My House for those who walk round it those who stay there for devotion and those who bow down and prostrate themselves
And when Abraham prayed My Lord make this city a city of peace and provide its inhabitants with fruits such of them as believe in God and the Last Day God said As for those who deny the truth I will grant them benefits for a short while and then subject them to the punishment of the Fire an evil destination
And when Abraham and Ishmael were laying the foundations of the House they prayed Our Lord accept this from us for You are All Hearing All Knowing
Lord make us submissive to You make of our descendants a nation that will submit to You
Teach us our rites of worship and turn to us with mercy You are the Forgiving One and the Merciful
Our Lord send forth to them a messenger of their own to recite Your revelations to them to teach them the Scripture and wisdom and purify them
You are the Mighty the Wise One
Who but a foolish man would turn away from the religion of Abraham
We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous
When his Lord said to him Surrender he responded I have surrendered to the Lord of the Universe
and Abraham enjoined his sons to do the same as did Jacob My sons God has chosen this religion for you so do not let death overtake you except when you are in a state of submission
Were you present when Jacob faced the hour of death and he asked his sons Who will you worship after me
They answered We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac the one God we have submitted ourselves to Him
Those were a people that have passed away what they did is theirs and what you have done is yours
You will not be answerable for their deeds
They say Be Jews or Christians and you shall be rightly guided
Say By no means
We believe in the faith of Abraham who was ever inclined to God he was not one of those who set up partners with God
Say We believe in God and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and their descendants and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the other prophets by their Lord
We make no distinction between any of them
It is to Him that we surrender ourselves
If they believe as you have believed then are they rightly guided but if they turn back then know that they are entrenched in hostility God will surely suffice to defend you against them for He is All Hearing All Knowing
We take on God s own dye
Who has a better dye than God s
We worship Him alone
Say Do you dispute with us about God while He is our Lord and your Lord
We have our actions and you have your actions
We are devoted to Him alone
Do you claim that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and their descendants were all Jews or Christians Say Do you know better or does God
And who could be more unjust than one who conceals a testimony given to him by God God is not unaware of what you do
Those were a people that have passed away theirs is what they did and yours what you have done
You shall not be answerable for their deeds
The foolish will ask What has made them turn away from their direction of prayer which they used to face
Say The East and the West belong to God
He guides whom He pleases to the right path
Thus We have made you a middle nation so that you may act as witnesses for mankind and the Messenger may be a witness for you
We decreed your former prayer direction towards which you used to face only in order that We might make a clear distinction between the Messenger s true followers and those who were to turn their backs on him
This was indeed a hard test for all but those whom God has guided
God will never let your faith go to waste
God is compassionate and merciful to mankind
We have frequently seen you turn your face towards heaven
So We will make you turn in a direction for prayer that will please you
So turn your face now towards the Sacred Mosque and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it
Those who were given the Book know this to be the truth from their Lord
God is not unaware of what they do
But even if you should produce every kind of sign for those who have been given the Book they would never accept your prayer direction nor would you accept their prayer direction nor would any of them accept one another s direction If after all the knowledge you have been given you yield to their desires then you shall surely become a transgressor
Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it just as they recognize their own sons
But some of them knowingly conceal the truth
Truth is what comes from your Lord therefore do not be of those who doubt
Each community has its own direction in which it turns vie then with one another in doing good works
Wherever you may be God will bring you all before Him
God has power over all things
Wherever you set out from turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque this is the truth from your Lord He is not unaware of what you do
wherever you come from turn your face to the Sacred Mosque wherever you may be turn your faces towards it so that people will not have any argument against you except for the wrongdoers among them Do not fear them fear Me so that I may perfect My favour to you and you may be rightly guided
Thus We have sent among you a Messenger of your own to recite Our revelations to you purify you and teach you the Book and wisdom and to teach you what you did not know
So remember Me I will remember you
Be thankful to Me and do not be ungrateful
You who believe seek help through patience and prayer surely God is with the steadfast
Do not say that those who are killed in God s cause are dead they are alive but you are not aware of it
We shall certainly test you with fear and hunger and loss of property lives and crops
Give good news to those who endure with fortitude
Those who say when afflicted with a calamity We belong to God and to Him we shall return
are the ones who will have blessings and mercy from their Lord it is they who are on the right path
Safa and Marwah are among the symbols set up by God there is nothing wrong if anyone goes on a pilgrimage to the House or performs a minor pilgrimage in walking to and fro between them
Of anyone who does good of his own accord God is appreciative and aware
Those who conceal the evidence of the truth and the guidance We have revealed after We have made them clear to people in the Scripture will be rejected by God and so do others
But from those who repent and mend their ways and make known the truth I will certainly accept their repentance I am the Ever Relenting the Most Merciful
Those who deny the truth and die as deniers on them shall be the curse of God and of angels and of men altogether
Under it they shall remain forever their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be granted respite
Your God is one God There is no deity save Him
He is the Compassionate the Merciful
In the creation of the heavens and the earth in the alternation of night and day in the ships that sail the ocean bearing cargoes beneficial to man in the water which God sends down from the sky and with which He revives the earth after its death scattering over it all kinds of animals in the courses of the winds and in the clouds pressed into service between earth and sky there are indeed signs for people who use their reason
Yet there are some who set up equals with God and adore them with the adoration due to God but those who believe love God most
If only the wrongdoers could see as they will see when they face the punishment that all power belongs to God and that God is severe in punishment
When they face their punishment those who have been followed will disown their followers and all their ties shall be cut asunder
those who followed will say If we could only return to the world we would disown them as they have disowned us
God will thus show them their actions as a cause of bitter regret and remorse They shall never emerge from the Fire
O mankind eat whatever is lawful and wholesome on the earth and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan for he is indeed your avowed enemy
He bids you only to do evil and to commit deeds of abomination and to attribute to God something of which you have no knowledge
But when they are told Follow what God has sent down they answer We will follow the ways of our fathers even though their fathers did not use their reason and were devoid of all guidance
Those who deny the truth are like animals which hear nothing in your call but the sound of a voice without understanding its meaning
They are deaf dumb and blind
They understand nothing
Believers eat the wholesome things which We have provided for you and give thanks to God if it is Him you worship
He has forbidden you only carrion blood and the flesh of swine also any flesh that is consecrated other than in the name of God
But for one who is driven by necessity neither craving nor transgressing it is no sin
For God is forgiving and merciful
Those who conceal any part of the Scriptures which God has revealed in order to gain some paltry end simply fill their bellies with Fire
On the Day of Resurrection God will neither speak to them nor purify them
They will have a painful punishment
Those are the ones who have taken error in exchange for guidance and punishment for forgiveness
How little do they seem to fear the Fire
That is because God has sent down the Book with the truth
And those who pursue differences in the Scriptures go much too far in dissension
Virtue does not consist in whether you face towards the East or the West virtue means believing in God the Last Day the angels the Book and the prophets the virtuous are those who despite their love for it give away their wealth to their relatives and to orphans and the very poor and to travellers and those who ask for charity and to set slaves free and who attend to their prayers and pay the alms and who keep their pledges when they make them and show patience in hardship and adversity and in times of distress
Such are the true believers and such are the Godfearing
Believers retribution is prescribed for you in cases of murder the free man for the free man the slave for the slave the female for the female
If the offender is granted some remission by the heir of the slain person the agreed penalty should be equitably exacted and should be discharged in a handsome manner
This is an alleviation from your Lord and an act of grace
He who transgresses after this shall have a painful punishment
In this law of retribution there is life for you O people of understanding so that perhaps you will be mindful of God
It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you and he is leaving behind wealth he shall make a will in favour of his parents and relatives equitably
This is a duty for all who fear God
Anyone who alters it once he has heard it shall be accountable for his crime
Surely God is all hearing and all knowing
But if anyone apprehends partiality or an injustice on the part of a testator it shall be no sin for him to bring about a settlement between the parties
God is forgiving and merciful
Believers fasting has been prescribed for you just as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may guard yourselves against evil
Fast for a specified number of days but if any one among you is ill or on a journey let him fast the same number of days later
For those who can fast only with extreme difficulty there is a way to compensate the feeding of a needy person
But he who does good of his own accord shall be well rewarded but to fast is better for you if you only knew
The month of Ramadan is the month when the Quran was sent down as guidance for mankind with clear proofs of guidance and the criterion by which to distinguish right from wrong
Therefore whoever of you is present in that month let him fast but he who is ill or on a journey shall fast a similar number of days later on
God desires ease for you not hardship He desires you to fast the whole month so that you may glorify Him for His having guided you and so that you may be grateful to Him
When My servants ask you about Me say that I am near I respond to the call of one who calls whenever he calls to Me let them then respond to Me and believe in Me so that they may be rightly guided
It has been made lawful for you to go to your wives on the night of the fast they are like a garment for you and you are like a garment for them
God is aware that you were deceiving yourselves and He has turned in mercy towards you and pardoned you
So you may now consort with them and seek what God has ordained for you
Eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black Then resume the fast until nightfall and do not approach them during the nights of your devotional retreat in the mosques
These are the limits set by God so do not approach them
Thus He makes clear His commandments to mankind so that they may guard themselves against evil
Do not consume one another s property by unjust means nor offer it as a bribe to the authorities so that you may deliberately and wrongfully devour a part of other people s wealth
They ask you about the phases of the moon
Say They are a means of determining time for the regulation of people s affairs and for the pilgrimage
Piety does not consist in entering your houses from the rear
Indeed one who guards himself against evil out of fear of God is the truly righteous one
Enter your houses by their doors and be mindful of God so that you may prosper
And fight in God s cause against those who wage war against you but do not commit aggression for surely God does not love aggressors
Slay them wherever you find them those who fight against you drive them out of the places from which they drove you for religious persecution is worse than killing
Do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they fight you there
If they do fight you slay them such is the reward for those who deny the truth
but if they desist then surely God is most forgiving and merciful
Fight them until there is no more fitna religious persecution and religion belongs to God alone If they desist then let there be no hostility except towards aggressors
A sacred month for a sacred month violation of sanctity calls for fair retribution
Thus you may exact retribution from whoever transgresses against you in proportion to his transgression
Fear God and know that God is with those who are mindful of Him
Spend for God s cause do not cast yourselves into destruction by your own hands
Do good God loves the doers of good
Perform the Hajj and the minor pilgrimage umrah for the sake of God If you are prevented from doing so then make whatever offering you can afford and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice
But if any of you is ill or has an ailment of the head he should compensate by fasting or almsgiving or sacrifice
In times of peace if any of you combines the minor pilgrimage with the Hajj he should make whatever offering he can afford but if he lacks the means then let him fast three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days after his return that is ten days in all
That is incumbent upon anyone whose family does not live near the Sacred Mosque
Fear God and know that God is severe in punishment
The pilgrimage is in the appointed months
Whoever intends to perform it during them must abstain from indecent speech from all wicked conduct and from quarrelling while on the pilgrimage
Whatever good you may do God is aware of it
Make provision for yourselves but surely the best of all provision is Godconsciousness
Always be mindful of Me you that are endowed with understanding
You will be committing no sin if during the pilgrimage you seek to obtain any bounty from your Lord
When you return from Arafat remember God at the sacred place and remember Him as He has guided you Before this you were surely astray
Then press on from where the pilgrims stream forth and ask God s forgiveness God is ever forgiving and most merciful
When you have performed the acts of worship prescribed for you celebrate the praises of God as you celebrated the praises of your fathers or even more fervently than that
There are some who say Our Lord give us abundance in this world
These shall have no share in the world to come
But there are others who pray Our Lord grant us good in this world as well as good in the world to come and protect us from the torment of the Fire
They shall have a good share from what they have earned
God is swift in His reckoning
Remember God during the appointed days for one who hastens to leave in two days it shall be no sin and for one who stays on it shall be no sin for him either
This is for one who fears God
Have fear of God and know that you shall all be gathered before Him
There are some men whose views on the affairs of this life may please you
They even call on God to witness whatever is in their heart yet they are the most contentious of quarrellers
When he turns away he sets out to spread corruption in the land destroying crops and cattle
God does not love corruption
When he is told Have fear of God he is seized by pride which drives him to wrongdoing
Hell shall be enough for him
A dreadful resting place
But there are others who would dedicate themselves to seeking the pleasure of God
God is compassionate to His servants
Believers surrender yourselves totally to God and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan surely he is your sworn enemy
But if you lapse after the clear signs that have come to you then know that God is mighty and wise
Are they only waiting for God as well as the angels to come down to them under canopies of clouds so that the matter will be settled
All things return to God
Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them
Anyone who changes God s blessing once it has come to him will find God is stern in punishment
The life of this world is made to appear attractive for those who deny the truth and they scoff at those who believe
But those who fear God shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection God bestows His bounties on whoever He pleases without stinting
Mankind was once a single community but then people developed differences so God sent prophets to them as bearers of good tidings and warning and sent down with them the Book containing the truth so that He might judge between their disputes
It was only those to whom it the scripture was given who disagreed about it after clear signs had come to them because of rivalry between them
God by His will guided the believers to the truth about which the others had disputed
God guides whom He will to a straight path
Do you think that you will enter Paradise without having suffered like those who passed away before you
Affliction and hardship befell them and so shaken were they that the Messenger and the believers with him would exclaim When will God s help come
Surely the help of God is near
They will ask you what they should spend on others Say Whatever you give should be for parents close relatives orphans the needy and travellers
God is well aware of whatever good you do
Fighting in defence is ordained for you abhorrent as it may be to you
You may dislike something although it is good for you or like something although it is bad for you God knows but you do not
They ask you about fighting in the sacred month
Say To fight in a sacred month is a grave matter but barring people from the path of God to deny Him and expelling people from the Sacred Mosque are far graver in His sight and persecution is worse than killing
They will not stop fighting you until they make you renounce your faith if they can
Whoever of you turns back from his faith and dies as a denier of the truth will have his deeds come to nothing in this world and the Hereafter and he will be an inhabitant of the Fire to abide therein forever
But those who have believed migrated and striven for God s cause can look forward to God s mercy God is forgiving and merciful
They ask you Prophet about intoxicants and gambling Say There is great sin in both although they have some benefit for people but their harm is greater than their benefit
They ask you what they should spend in God s cause
Say Whatever is surplus to your needs
Thus God makes His commandments clear to you so that you may reflect
upon this world and the Hereafter
They ask you about orphans
Say Promotion of their welfare is an act of great goodness
There is no harm in your living together with them for they are your brothers
God knows the mischiefmaker from the reformer
If God had so willed He would have afflicted you with hardship
Surely God is mighty and wise
Do not marry women who associate partners with God until they believe
A believing bondwoman is better than a woman who associates partners with God however pleasing she may appear to you
Nor give believing women in marriage to men who associate partners with God till they have believed a believing bondman is certainly better than a man who associates partners with God even though he may please you
Such people call you to Hellfire but God calls you to Paradise and to forgiveness He makes His messages clear to people so that they might bear them in mind
They ask you about menstruation
Say It is an impurity so keep away from women during it and do not approach them until they are cleansed when they are cleansed you may approach them as God has ordained
God loves those who turn to Him in penitence and He loves those who keep themselves clean
Your wives are your fields
Go then into your fields as you will
Do good deeds and fear God and know that you shall meet Him
Give good tidings to the believers
Do not make God a pretext when you swear by Him to avoid doing good being righteous and making peace between people
God is all hearing and all knowing
God will not call you to account for any oaths you uttered unintentionally but He will take you to task for what is intended in your hearts
God is most forgiving and forbearing
For those who swear that they will not approach their wives there shall be a waiting period of four months if they revert to conciliation surely God is most forgiving and ever merciful
but if they decide upon divorce God is all hearing and all knowing
Divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles it is unlawful for them if they believe in God and the Last Day to hide what God has created in their wombs
Their husbands have the right to take them back within that time if they desire to be reconciled
The wives have rights corresponding to those which the husbands have according to what is recognized to be fair but men have a rank above them
God is almighty and all wise
Divorce may be pronounced twice and then a woman must be retained honourably or released with kindness
It is not lawful for you to take away anything of what you have given your wives unless both fear that they would not be able to observe the bounds set by God
In such a case it shall be no sin for either of them if the woman opts to give something for her release
These are the bounds set by God do not transgress them
Those who transgress the bounds of God are wrongdoers
And if man finally divorces his wife he cannot remarry her until she has married another man
Then if the next husband divorces her there will be no blame on either of them if the former husband and wife return to one another provided they think that they can keep within the bounds set by God
These are the bounds prescribed by God which He makes clear to men of understanding
Once you divorce women and they have reached the end of their waiting period then either retain them in all decency or part from them decently
Do not retain them in order to harm them or to wrong them
Whoever does this wrongs his own soul
Do not make a mockery of God s revelations
Remember the favours God has bestowed upon you and the Book and the wisdom He has revealed to exhort you
Fear God and know that God is aware of everything
When you divorce women and they reach the end of their waiting period do not prevent them from marrying other men if they have come to an honourable agreement
This is enjoined on every one of you who believes in God and the Last Day it is more wholesome and purer for you
God knows but you do not know
And the divorced mothers should nurse their children for two whole years if they wish to complete the period of nursing and during that period the father of the child shall be responsible for the maintenance of the mother in a reasonable manner
No soul is charged with more than it can bear
No mother should be made to suffer on account of her child and no father should be made to suffer on account of his child
The same duties devolve upon the father s heir in case of the death of the father
But if after consultation they choose by mutual agreement to wean the child there shall be no blame on them
Nor shall it be any offence for you if you desire to engage a wetnurse for your children provided you hand over what you have agreed to pay in a reasonable manner
Have fear of God and know that God is observant of all your actions
If any of you die and leave widows the widows should wait for four months and ten days
When they have reached the end of their waiting period you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with themselves God is aware of what you do
It shall be no offence for you to hint at a proposal of marriage to divorced or widowed women or to cherish them in your hearts
God knows that you will bear them in mind
But do not enter into any secret arrangement with them beyond conveying some indication to them of your inclination
Do not proceed with tying the marriageknot before the end of their waiting period
Know that God has knowledge of all your thoughts
Therefore take heed and bear in mind that God is forgiving and forbearing
You will not be blamed for not paying the dower money if you divorce women when you have not yet consummated the marriage or fixed a dower money upon them but make fair provision for them the affluent according to his means and the straitened according to his means this is binding on righteous men
If you divorce them before the marriage is consummated but after their dower money has been settled give them the half of their dower money unless they the women agree to forego it or the man the husband in whose hand lies the marriage knot foregoes it
To forego is nearer to righteousness
Do not neglect any chance of behaving benevolently towards each other
God is observant of whatever you do
Be ever mindful of prayers especially the middle prayer and stand up before God in submissive devotion
When you are exposed to danger pray on foot or while riding when you are safe again remember God for He has taught you what you did not know
If any of you die and leave widows make a bequest for them of a year s maintenance without causing them to leave their homes but if they leave of their own accord you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with themselves
God is almighty and wise
For divorced women a provision according to what is fair shall also be made This is an obligation binding on the righteous
Thus God makes His commandments clear to you so that you may understand
Have you not seen those who fled their homes in their thousands for fear of death whereupon God said to them Die and later brought them back to life
Surely God is bountiful to mankind but most of them are ungrateful
Fight in defence in God s cause and remember that He is all hearing and all knowing
Who will give God a generous loan He will multiply it many times over
It is God who withholds and God who gives abundantly and it is to Him that you shall all be returned
Have you not heard of what the chiefs of the Children of Israel demanded of one of their prophets after Moses
They said Appoint for us a king and we will fight for the cause of God
He replied What if you refuse to fight when ordered to do so
Why should we not fight for the cause of God they replied when we have been driven forth from our homes and our children
But when at last they were commanded to fight they all refused except a few of them
God knows the wrongdoers
Their prophet said to them God has now appointed Talut to be your king
But they replied How can he be king over us when we are worthier of kingship than he and he has not even been granted an abundance of wealth
He said God has chosen him over you and has given him great knowledge and physique
God grants kingship to whoever He pleases God is magnanimous and all knowing
Their prophet also said to them The sign of his kingship is that the Ark of the Covenant shall come to you
Therein shall be tranquillity from your Lord and the relics which the House of Moses and the House of Aaron left behind
It will be borne by the angels
There is a sign in this for you if you believe
When Talut set out with his forces he said to them God will test you with a river whoever drinks from it is not with me and whoever does not drink is with me
There will however be no blame upon one who sips only a handful from it
But except for a few of them they all drank from it
When he and those who believed along with him had crossed the river they said We have no strength today against Goliath and his warriors
But those of them who believed that they would meet God replied Many a small group by God s command has prevailed against a large group
God is indeed with the steadfast
When they met Goliath and his warriors they said Our Lord bestow patience upon us make us stand firm and help us against those who deny the truth
And so by the command of God they defeated them
David killed Goliath and God gave him kingship and wisdom and imparted to him the knowledge of whatever He willed
Had it not been for God s repelling some people by means of others the earth would have been filled with corruption
But God is bountiful to His creatures
These are the revelations of God which We recite to you in all truth for you are truly one of the messengers
Of these messengers We have given something additional among them
There are some to whom God spoke directly and others He exalted in rank
We gave Jesus son of Mary clear signs and strengthened him with the holy spirit
Had God pleased those who succeeded them would not have fought against one another after the clear signs had come to them
But they disagreed among themselves some believed while others did not
Yet had God willed they would not have fought against one another but God does whatever He wills
Believers spend out of what We have given you before the Day comes when there will be neither trading friendship nor intercession
Truly it is those who deny the truth who are the wrongdoers
God there is no deity save Him the Living the Eternal One Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him
To Him belong whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth
Who can intercede with Him except by His permission
He knows all that is before them and all that is behind them
They can grasp only that part of His knowledge which He wills
His throne extends over the heavens and the earth and their upholding does not weary Him
He is the Sublime the Almighty One
There shall be no compulsion in religion true guidance has become distinct from error
But whoever refuses to be led by Satan and believes in God has grasped the strong handhold that will never break
God is all hearing and all knowing
God is the patron of the faithful He leads them from darkness to the light
As for those who deny the truth their supporter is Satan who brings them out of light into darkness
They are the heirs of the Fire and there they will remain forever
Have you not heard of him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had bestowed the kingdom upon him
Abraham said My Lord is the one who gives life and brings death He answered I too give life and bring death
Abraham said God brings up the sun from the east so bring it up yourself from the west
Then the disbeliever was confounded God does not guide the wrongdoers
Or of him who when passing by a town the roofs of which had caved in exclaimed How will God restore it to life after its destruction
Thereupon God caused him to die and after a hundred years brought him back to life
God asked How long have you remained in this state He answered I have remained a day or part of a day
God said No you have remained in this state for a hundred years
Now look at your food and your drink they have not rotted
Look at your ass
We will make you a sign to mankind
Look at the bones how We set them together then clothe them with flesh
When it had all become clear to him he said Now I know that God has power over all things
When Abraham said Show me my Lord how You revive the dead God said Do you not believe
Abraham answered Yes indeed I do believe but just to reassure my heart
Then God said Take four birds and train them to come back to you Then place them separately on each hilltop and call them they will come flying to you
Know that God is almighty and wise
Those who spend their wealth for God s cause may be compared to a grain of corn which sprouts into seven ears with a hundred grains in each ear for God grants manifold increase to whom He wills God is infinite and all knowing
Those who spend their wealth for God s cause and do not follow their almsgiving with taunts and insults shall be rewarded by their Lord they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
A kind word and forgiveness is better than a charitable deed followed by hurtful words God is selfsufficient and forbearing
Believers do not cancel out your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words like one who spends his wealth only to be seen by people and not believing in God and the Last Day
Such men are like a rock covered with earth a shower falls upon it and leaves it hard and bare
They will gain nothing from their works
God does not guide those who deny the truth
But those who spend their wealth in order to gain God s approval and to strengthen their souls are like a garden on elevated ground
When heavy rain falls on it it doubles its produce and if heavy rain does not fall then light rain suffices God sees what you do
Would any of you being a man well advanced in age with helpless children to support like to have a garden of dates and grapes watered by rivers and containing all kinds of fruits stricken by a fiery whirlwind and utterly scorched
Thus God makes His signs clear to you so that you may reflect
Believers give charitably from the good things which you have earned and what We produce for you from the earth not worthless things which you yourselves would only reluctantly accept Know that God is selfsufficient and praiseworthy
Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and commands you to do foul deeds
But God promises His forgiveness and His bounty
God is bountiful and all knowing
He grants wisdom to whom He will and whoever is granted wisdom has indeed been granted abundant wealth
Yet none bear this in mind except those endowed with understanding
Whatever you spend and whatever vows you make are known to God but the wrongdoers shall have no helpers
If you give charity openly it is good but if you keep it secret and give to the needy in private that is better for you and it will atone for some of your bad deeds
God is aware of all that you do
It is not your responsibility to make them follow the right path God guides whomever He pleases Whatever wealth you spend is to your own benefit provided that you spend only to seek the favour of God Whatever wealth you spend for God s cause shall be repaid to you in full and you shall not be wronged
The needy who are too engrossed in God s cause to be able to travel about the land in search of a livelihood are considered by those who are unaware of their condition to be free from want because they refrain from begging
But they can be known from their appearance
They do not make insistent demands upon people
Whatever wealth you spend God knows it
Those who spend their wealth night and day both privately and publicly will receive their reward from their Lord
They shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Those who live on usury shall rise up before God like men whom Satan has demented by his touch for they say Buying and selling is only a kind of usury
But God has made trade lawful and made usury unlawful
Therefore he who desists because of the admonition that has come to him from his Lord may retain what he has received in the past and it will be for God to judge him
Those who revert to it shall be the inmates of the Fire they shall abide therein forever
God blights usury and blesses charitable deeds
God does not love the ungrateful wrongdoer
Those who believe do good deeds attend to their prayers and engage in almsgiving shall be rewarded by their Lord and shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
Believers have fear of God and give up what is still due to you from usury if you are true believers
For if you do not do so then know that you are at war with God and His Messenger
But if you repent you may retain your capital
Do not wrong others and you will not be wronged
If the debtor is in straitened circumstances then grant him respite till a time of ease
If you were to write it off as an act of charity that would be better for you if only you knew
Fear the Day when you shall be made to return to God then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
Believers when you contract a debt for a stated term put it down in writing have a scribe write it down with fairness between you
No scribe should refuse to write let him write as God has taught him let the debtor dictate and let him fear God his Lord and not diminish the debt at all
If the debtor is weak in mind or body or unable to dictate then in fairness let his guardian dictate for him
Call in two of your men as witnesses
But if two men cannot be found then call one man and two women out of those you approve of as witnesses so that if one of the two women should forget the other can remind her
Let the witnesses not refuse when they are summoned
Do not be disinclined to write down your debts be they small or large together with the date of payment
This is more just in the sight of God it is more reliable as testimony and more likely to prevent doubts arising between you unless it be ready merchandise which you give or take from hand to hand then it will not be held against you for not writing it down
Have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness for if you did cause them harm it would be a crime on your part
Be mindful of God He teaches you He has full knowledge of everything
If you are on a journey and do not find any literate person something should be handed over as security
If one of you entrusts another with something let the trustee restore the pledge to its owner and let him fear God his Lord
Do not conceal testimony
If someone does conceal it in his heart he commits a crime
God knows what you do
All that the heavens and the earth contain belongs to God whether you disclose what is in your minds or keep it hidden God will bring you to account for it
He will forgive whom He will and punish whom He pleases He has power over all things
The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord and so do believers
They all believe in God and His angels His scriptures and His messengers They say We do not differentiate between any of His messengers
We hear and obey
Grant us Your forgiveness Lord to You we shall all return
God does not charge a soul with more than it can bear
It shall be requited for whatever good and whatever evil it has done
They pray Our Lord do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake
Our Lord do not place on us a burden like the one You placed on those before us
Our Lord do not place on us a burden we have not the strength to bear
Pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us
You are our Lord and Sustainer so help us against those who deny the truth
Alif Lam Mim
God There is no deity save Him the Living the Sustainer
He has sent down the Book to you with truth which fulfils the predictions in the Scriptures that preceded it He sent down the Torah and the Gospel
in the past as guidance for mankind He has also sent down the Standard by which to discern the true from the false
Surely those who deny God s signs will suffer severe punishment
God is mighty and capable of retribution
Nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from God
it is He who shapes you in the womb as He will
There is no deity save Him the Mighty the Wise One
It is He who has sent down the Book to you
Some of its verses are clear and precise in meaning they are the basis of the Book while others are allegorical
Those with deviation in their hearts pursue the allegorical so as to create dissension by seeking to explain it but no one knows its meaning except God
Those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say We believe in it it is all from our Lord
But only the wise take heed
Our Lord do not let our hearts deviate after You have guided us
Bestow upon us Your mercy Surely You are a Munificent Giver
Our Lord You will surely gather all mankind on the Day of whose coming there is no doubt
God never fails to fulfill His promise
As for those who deny the truth their wealth and children will not help them against God
They will be fuel for the Fire
Their end will be like Pharaoh s people and those before them they denied Our signs so God seized them in their sinfulness God is stern in punishment
Say to those who deny the truth You shall be overcome and driven into Hell an evil resting place
There was a sign for you in the two groups which met face to face at Badr one party fighting for the cause of God and the other made up of those who deny the truth The faithful saw with their own eyes that the others were twice their number but God strengthens with His succour whom He wills In this there is indeed a lesson for all who have eyes to see
The satisfaction of worldly desires through women and children and heapedup treasures of gold and silver and pedigreed horses and cattle and lands is attractive to people
All this is the provision of the worldly life but the most excellent abode is with God
Say Shall I tell you of something better than all of these
For the Godfearing there are Gardens in nearness to their God with rivers flowing through them where they shall live forever with pure spouses and the goodwill of God
God is watching His servants
those who say Lord we believe in You forgive us our sins and keep us from the punishment of the Fire
those who are steadfast truthful obedient and those who spend for God s cause and who pray before dawn for forgiveness
God bears witness that there is no deity save Him as do the angels and those who possess knowledge
He is the upholder of justice There is no diety save Him the Mighty the Wise One
The only true religion in God s sight is complete submission to God
And those who were given the Book disagreed only out of rivalry after knowledge had been given to them he who denies God s signs should know that God is swift in His reckoning
If they dispute with you say I have submitted my whole being to God and so have those who follow me
And ask those who have been given the Book as well as the unlettered Do you submit yourselves to God in the same way
If they submit themselves to Him they are on the right path but if they turn away your duty is only to convey the message
God is observant of all His servants
Those who deny God s signs and kill the prophets unjustly and kill those who enjoin justice give them warning of a woeful punishment
their deeds will come to nothing in this world as well as in the hereafter they will have no supporters
Have you not seen those who received a portion of the Book
When they are invited to accept the judgement of God s Book a group of them turns away in aversion
That is because they say The Fire will touch us only for a limited number of days
Thus the false beliefs which they have invented have deluded them in the matter of their religion
How will it be when We gather them all together upon a Day which is sure to come when every human being shall be repaid in full for what he has done They will not be wronged
Say Lord sovereign of all sovereignty
You bestow sovereignty on whom you will and take it away from whom You please You exalt whoever You will and abase whoever You will
All that is good lies in Your hands
You have the power to will anything
You cause the night to pass into the day and the day into the night You bring forth the living from the lifeless and the lifeless from the living
You give without measure to whom You will
Let not the believers take those who deny the truth for their allies in preference to the believers anyone who does that will isolate himself completely from God unless it be to protect yourselves against them in this way God admonishes you to fear Him for to God shall all return
Say God knows everything that is in your heart whether you conceal it or reveal it He knows everything that the heavens and earth contain God has power over all things
On the Day when every human being will find himself faced with all the good that he has done and with all the evil that he has done many will wish that there were a long space of time between himself and that Day
God admonishes you to fear Him but God is compassionate towards His servants
Say If you love God follow me and God will love you and forgive you your sins
God is most forgiving and most merciful
Say Obey God and the Messenger and if they turn away God does not love those who deny the truth
God chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Imran above all His creatures
They are the offspring of one another
God hears all and knows all
Remember when the wife of Imran said My Lord I have dedicated what is in my womb entirely to Your service
So accept this from me
You are the One who hears and knows all
When she gave birth she said My Lord I have given birth to a girl God knew very well what she had given birth to a male is not like a female I have named her Mary and placed her and her children in Your protection from the rejected Satan
Her Lord graciously accepted her and made her grow in goodness and entrusted her to the care of Zachariah
Every time Zachariah visited her in her chamber he found some provision with her
He asked Mary where did this provision come from She replied This is from God
God provides for whoever He wills without measure
Thereupon Zachariah prayed to his Lord saying Lord grant me by Your own grace virtuous offspring
You are the hearer of all prayers
As he stood praying in the chamber the angels called out to him saying God gives you the good news of John who shall confirm the Word from God and shall be outstanding among men and utterly chaste and a prophet from among the righteous
Lord said Zachariah how shall I have a son when I am now overtaken by old age and my wife is barren
Such is the will of God replied the angel He does what He pleases
He said My Lord grant me a sign
The angel said Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days except by signs
Remember your Lord much and glorify Him morning and evening
The angels said Mary God has selected you and purified you He has selected you over all the women of your time
O Mary Remain truly devout to your Sustainer and prostrate yourself in worship and bow down with those who bow down before Him
This is an account of the unseen which We reveal to you
You were not with them when they drew lots as to which of them should be Mary s guardian and you were not with them when they disputed with one another
When the angels said O Mary your Lord gives you good news of a Word from Him
His name is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary honoured in this world and in the next and one of those who are granted nearness to God
And he shall speak to men in his cradle and as a grown man and shall be one of the righteous
Lord she said how can I have a child when no man has touched me
The angel replied Thus it is God creates what He wills when He wills a thing He need only say Be and it is
God will instruct him in the Book and in wisdom and in the Torah and in the Gospel
He will make him a messenger to the Children of Israel
He will say I have come to you with a sign from your Lord
I will make the shape of a bird out of clay for you and then breathe into it and by God s leave it will become a living bird
And by God s leave I will heal the blind and the leper and bring the dead to life
I will tell you what you eat and what you store up in your homes
Surely in this there is a sign for you if you are believers
I come to fulfill the prediction of the Torah which preceded me and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you and I come to you with a sign from your Lord
So fear God and obey me
God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him
That is the straight path
When Jesus perceived their denial he said Who will be my helpers in God s cause
The disciples said We are God s helpers we believe in God
Bear witness that we have surrendered ourselves
Our Lord we believe in what You have sent down and we follow the messenger so count us among those who bear witness
And they schemed but God also schemed and God is the Best of Schemers
God said O Jesus I shall take you to Me and will raise you up to Me and shall clear you of the calumnies of the disbelievers and shall place those who follow you above those who deny the truth until the Day of Judgement then to Me shall all return and I will judge between you regarding your disputes
Those who deny the truth shall be sternly punished in this world and in the world to come there shall be none to help them
As for those who have believed and do good works they shall be given their reward in full
God does not love evildoers
This which We recite to you is a revelation and a wise reminder
Jesus in the sight of God is like Adam
He created him from dust then said to him Be and he was
This is the truth from your Lord so do not be among the doubters
And if anyone should argue with you about this truth after the knowledge you have received say to them Come Let us gather our sons and your sons our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and then let us pray earnestly and invoke the curse of God upon the liars
This is the true account
There is no deity save Him
God is Mighty and Wise
And if they turn away God knows well the evildoers
Say People of the Book let us come to a word common to us that we shall worship none but God and that we shall associate no partner with Him and that none of us shall take others besides God for lords And if they turn away say Bear witness that we have submitted to God
People of the Book why do you dispute about Abraham when the Torah and Gospel were only sent down after him Do you not use your reason
You are those who disputed about things of which you had some knowledge Must you now argue about things of which you have no knowledge
God knows but you do not know
Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian
He was an upright man one who had surrendered himself to God He was not one of those who associate partners with God
Surely the people who are closest to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet Muhammad and those who believe in him
God is the guardian of the believers
Some of the People of the Book wish to lead you astray but they only lead themselves astray though they do not realise it
People of the Book Why do you deny God s signs having been witnesses thereof
People of the Book Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth
Some of the People of the Book say to one another Believe in what is revealed to the faithful in the morning and deny it in the evening so that they the Muslims may themselves abandon their faith in confusion
Believe only in those who follow your own religion
Say to them Surely the true guidance is the guidance from God
But you think it is impossible that someone else may be granted revelation such as you were granted or else that they should contend against you before your Lord
Say All grace is in the hands of God He grants it to whom He wills for God is boundless and all knowing
He singles out for His mercy whoever He pleases
God is the Lord of exceeding bounty
Among the people of the Book there are some who if you entrust them with a heap of gold will return it to you But there are others of them who if you entrust them with a single dinar will not return it to you unless you keep demanding it from them
That is because they say We are under no obligation towards the gentiles They deliberately tell lies about God
Indeed God loves those who honour their covenants and fear Him God loves the righteous
Those who sell out God s covenant and their oaths for a paltry price will have no share in the life to come on the Day of Resurrection
God will neither speak to them nor cast a look upon them on the Day of Judgement nor will He purify them
For them there shall be a grievous punishment
There are some among them who distort the Book by the way they speak to make you think that what they say is from the Book whereas it is not They say it is from God whereas it is not Thus they tell a lie about God and they know it
No one to whom God has given the Scriptures and on whom He has bestowed wisdom and prophethood would say to men Worship me instead of God
He would say rather Be devoted servants of God for you have taught and studied the Scriptures
Nor would he enjoin you to take the angels and the prophets as your lords how could he command you to be disbelievers after you have submitted to God
When God made a covenant with the prophets He said Here is the Book and the wisdom which I have given you When there comes to you a messenger fulfilling that predictions about him in their Scripture which is with you you must believe in him and help him
Do you then affirm this and accept the responsibility I have laid upon you in these terms
They said We will affirm it
God said Then bear witness and I will bear witness with you
Now whoever turns away after this are surely transgressors
Do they seek a religion other than the religion of God when everything in the heavens and the earth has submitted to Him willingly or unwillingly To Him they shall all return
Say We believe in God and in what has been sent down to us and to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the Tribes We believe in what has been given to Moses Jesus and the prophets from their Lord
We make no distinction between any of them It is to Him that we have surrendered ourselves
If anyone seeks a religion other than Islam submission to God it will not be accepted from him he will be among the losers in the Hereafter
How would God bestow His guidance upon people who have opted for unbelief after having embraced the faith and having borne witness that this Messenger is true and after all evidence of the truth has come to them
For God does not guide such wrongdoers
such people will be rewarded with rejection by God by the angels by all mankind
In this state they shall abide forever their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be granted respite
Except for those who afterwards repent and reform
God is forgiving and merciful
but as for those who are bent on denying the truth after accepting the true faith and grow in their refusal to acknowledge the truth their repentance will not be accepted
They are the ones who have gone far astray
Those who reject faith and die in the state of rejection will not be saved even if they offer as ransom enough gold to fill the entire earth
Painful punishment is in store for them and they will have no supporters
Never will you attain to righteousness unless you spend for the cause of God out of what you cherish and whatever you spend is known to God
All food was lawful for the Children of Israel except whatever Israel had made unlawful for himself before the Torah was sent down
Say to them Bring the Torah then and read it if you are truthful
Those who after this persist in making up lies and attributing them to God are transgressors
Say God speaks the Truth so follow the faith of Abraham
He was an upright man and he was not one of the polytheists
The first House to be built for mankind was the one at Bakkah Makkah It is a blessed place a source of guidance for the whole world
There are clear signs in it it is the place where Abraham stood
Anyone who enters it will be secure
Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to God for anyone who is able to undertake it
Anyone who disbelieves should remember that God is independent of all creatures
Say People of the Book why do you reject God s revelations when God is witness to all that you do
Say People of the Book why do you turn the believers away from the path of God seeking to make it crooked while you are witnesses thereof
God is not unaware of what you do
O believers if you yield to some of those who were given the Scripture they will cause you to renounce the truth after you have believed
But how can you deny the truth when God s revelations are being conveyed to you and His own Messenger is in your midst
He who holds fast to God is indeed guided to the straight path
Believers fear God as is His due and when death comes be in a state of complete submission to Him
Hold fast to the cord of God and let nothing divide you
Remember the blessings He has bestowed upon you you were enemies and then He united your hearts and by His grace you became brothers you were on the brink of an abyss of Fire and He rescued you from it
Thus God makes His signs clear to you so that you may find guidance
Let there be a group among you who call others to good and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong those who do this shall be successful
Do not be like those who after they had been given clear evidence split into factions and differed among themselves a terrible punishment awaits such people
On the Day when some faces are bright and some faces are dark it will be said to those with darkened faces Did you reject faith after accepting it
Taste then this punishment for having denied the truth
But as for those with shining faces they shall abide forever in God s grace
These are God s revelations We recite them to you in all truth
God desires no injustice to mankind
His is all that the heavens and the earth contain
To God shall all things return
You are indeed the best community that has ever been brought forth for the good of mankind You enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil and you believe in God
If the People of the Book had also believed it would have surely been better for them
Some of them are true believers but most of them are disobedient
They can do you very little harm if they come out to fight you they will show you their backs then they shall not be helped
abasement shall attend them wherever they are found unless they make a covenant with God or with man
They have incurred God s wrath and have been utterly humbled because they have persistently disbelieved in God s signs and killed prophets unjustly
This resulted from their disobedience and their habit of transgression
Yet they are not all alike
Of the People of the Book there are some who stand by their covenant they recite the word of God during the night and prostrate themselves before Him
who believe in God and the Last Day who enjoin justice and forbid evil and vie with each other in good works
These are righteous men
and they will not be denied the reward for whatever good deeds they do God knows the righteous
As for those who deny the truth neither their possessions nor their children shall avail them in the least against God
They will be inmates of the Fire They will remain there for ever
that which they spend in pursuit of the life of this world is like a biting frosty blast which smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it
God is not unjust to them they are unjust to their own souls
Believers do not take outsiders as your intimate friends they will spare no effort to harm you
They love to see you suffer their hatred is evident from the words which fall from their mouths
But what their hearts conceal is far worse
We have made Our signs clear to you will you not understand
It is you who love them but they do not love you you believe in all the revealed Books
When they meet you they say We believe but when they are alone they bite their fingertips with rage
Say Die of rage
God is aware of what your hearts contain
Whenever something good happens to you it grieves them but when evil befalls you they rejoice
If you persevere and fear God their designs will never harm you in the least God encompasses all that they do
When you set out at dawn from your home to assign battle positions to the believers God hears all and knows all
When two groups from among you were about to lose heart God was their protector
In God let the faithful put their trust
God had already helped you at Badr when you were weak
Fear God so that you may be grateful
And remember when you said to the believers Does it not suffice that your Lord helps you by sending down three thousand angels
If you remain patient and Godfearing and the enemy should fall upon you all of a sudden Your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels clearly marked
and God ordained this only as good news for you so that your hearts might be comforted help comes only from God the Powerful the Wise One
and so that He might cut off a portion of those who are bent on denying the truth or abase them so that they might be turned back frustrated
You have no say in this affair to decide whether He will relent towards them or He will punish them they are wrongdoers
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth belong to God
He forgives whoever He pleases and punishes whoever He pleases
God is most forgiving and ever merciful
Believers do not devour usury multiplied many times over
Fear God so that you may prosper
guard yourself against the Fire prepared for those who deny the truth
and obey God and the Messenger so that you may be given mercy
And vie with one another for your Lord s forgiveness and for a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth which has been prepared for the Godfearing
for those who spend both in prosperity and adversity who restrain their anger and are forgiving towards their fellow men God loves those who do good works
And who when they have committed an indecency or have wronged their souls remember God and pray that their sins be forgiven for who but God can forgive sins and do not knowingly persist in their misdeeds
their recompense is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens with rivers flowing through them where they will abide forever
How excellent will be the reward of those who do good works
There are many examples of the communities that have passed away before you travel through the land and see what was the end of those who rejected the Truth
This Quran is an exposition for the people and a guidance and admonition for those who fear God
And do not become faint of heart nor grieve you will have the upper hand if you are believers
if you have suffered a wound they too have suffered a similar wound
We bring these days to men by turns so that God may know those who believe and choose witnesses from among you and God does not love the unjust
so that God may purge those who believe and wipe out those who deny the truth
Do you suppose that you would enter the Garden without God knowing those among you who would strive hard for His cause and endure with fortitude
You were longing for death before you met it
Now you have seen it with your own eyes
Muhammad is only a messenger
Messengers have passed away before him
If he should die or be killed will you turn back on your heels
Those who turn on their heels do not harm the Lord in the least
God will reward the grateful
No soul shall die except with God s permission and at an appointed time
And if one desires the rewards of this world We shall grant it to him and if one desires the rewards of the life to come We shall grant it to him
We will reward the grateful
How many a prophet has fought with many devout men alongside him
They did not lose heart despite all that they had to suffer in God s path They neither weakened nor yielded
God loves the patient
All they said was Our Lord forgive us our sins and our excesses
Make our feet firm and help us against those who deny the truth
and so God gave them both the rewards of this life and the excellent recompense of the life to come God loves those who do good
Believers if you yield to those who deny the truth they will cause you to turn back on your heels and you will turn into losers
No indeed it is God who is your protector He is the best supporter
We will strike awe into the hearts of those who deny the truth because they have associated partners with God for which He has sent down no authority
